//! One loaded checkpoint and everything a caller does with it.
//!
//! `load` brings the files into memory, `text` turns prompts into the exact
//! tokens this checkpoint expects, `infer` runs the model and samples from
//! it, and `device` names where and in what precision all of that happens.
//! What stays here is the handle itself and what it can be asked about
//! without running anything.
