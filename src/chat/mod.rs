//! chat.rs — the conversation format a checkpoint was actually trained in.
//!
//! Every other tokenizer path in Ster treats text as a bare completion prompt,
//! which is exactly right for a base model and wrong for every instruct
//! checkpoint published in the last two years. Those models were post-trained
//! with a *chat template*: roles wrapped in special markers, recorded as a
//! Jinja string in `tokenizer_config.json` under `chat_template` (or, on newer
//! repositories, in a standalone `chat_template.jinja`). Fine-tuning such a
//! model on untemplated text teaches it a format it will never see at
//! inference, and generating from it without the template produces the
//! rambling continuations that make people think a checkpoint is broken.
//!
//! **The Jinja decision.** These templates are real Jinja2 — loops, tests,
//! filters, `raise_exception`, namespaces — and a hand-rolled renderer that
//! understands most of that subset is the worst possible outcome: it fails
//! silently into plausible-looking, wrongly-marked training data rather than
//! loudly into an error. So this module takes exactly one dependency,
//! [`minijinja`], a pure-Rust Jinja2 engine with no C code and one transitive
//! crate, and adds only what Hugging Face's renderer adds on top of stock
//! Jinja: the `raise_exception` and `strftime_now` globals, and the handful of
//! Python string and mapping methods templates call as methods rather than
//! filters. Anything outside that is an error from the engine, with the
//! template's own line number, which is the failure mode this module wants.
