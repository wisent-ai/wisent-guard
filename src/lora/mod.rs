//! Low-rank adapters: the only weights Ster ever trains, and the document that carries them.
//!
//! Ster's base model is mapped read-only from safetensors and never enters a
//! [`VarMap`], so the tensors registered here are by construction the complete
//! trainable set. An adapter is a pair `(a, b)` with `a: [rank, in]` and
//! `b: [out, rank]`; the update applied to a projection is
//! `scale * x @ a^T @ b^T`, which is the low-rank factorisation written in the
//! order that never materialises the dense `out x in` product.
//!
//! The live weights are in `adapter`; the document they are written to and
//! read back from is in `artifact`. What stays here is the shape an operator
//! asks for: which projections carry adapters, and at what rank.
