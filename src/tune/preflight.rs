// MARK: - Shared trainer setup

/// Everything an adapter trainer checks before it touches a model, and the
/// four words it says it in.
///
/// Four objectives run the same five checks against the same numbers. Copying
/// them would let one copy gain a check the others silently lacked, so they
/// live here once, and the vocabulary is what makes one set of checks refuse
/// in four voices:
///
/// * `subject` opens every sentence.
/// * `unit` is one item of the training set — an example, a pair, a prompt.
/// * `pass` is one traversal of it. Three objectives call that an epoch;
///   policy optimization calls it an iteration, because it re-samples rather
///   than re-reading and is not seeing the same data twice.
/// * `noun` names the tensors in the opening progress line. Most runs train
///   adapters and nothing else, but a reward run also trains a scalar head,
///   and calling that an adapter would be wrong.
///
/// The supervised sentences are the ones the runbook quotes and this
/// vocabulary keeps them byte-identical.
