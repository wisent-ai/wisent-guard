//! tune.rs — training the only weights Ster owns.
//!
//! Everything else in Ster is forward-only: it reads hidden states, fits a
//! direction over them, and adds that direction back during decode. Nothing
//! there needs a gradient with respect to a weight. This module is the one
//! place that does.
//!
//! It is a root, not an objective. Each objective is a sibling file that owns
//! only its own loss, options and report — [`sft`] a masked next-token
//! cross-entropy, [`dpo`] the preference losses, [`reward`] a Bradley-Terry
//! head, [`grpo`] a group-relative policy gradient — and everything more than
//! one of them needs lives here: the preflight checks, the input formats, the
//! tokenizers, the log-probability readers, the softplus and the learning-rate
//! schedule. None of the four is privileged; they are re-exported flat, so a
//! caller writes `tune::sft` and `tune::grpo` side by side and the file split
//! stays an implementation detail.
//!
//! Two properties hold across all four and are structural rather than
//! conventional:
//!
//! * **Only what the run created trains.** `Runtime::load_trainable` maps the
//!   base weights read-only and registers nothing but the low-rank pairs in the
//!   `VarMap`; a reward run adds its scalar head to that same map. The
//!   optimizer is constructed from `varmap.all_vars()`, so there is no base
//!   weight it could reach even if a loss asked for one.
//! * **The frozen reference is free.** Because `B` starts at zero, the base
//!   weights *are* the model every adapter started as. Any objective that needs
//!   a reference — the preference losses, the policy gradient's KL — gets it by
//!   skipping the adapters for one pass rather than by loading a second
//!   checkpoint.
//!
//! The four objectives live in `objective`, the two operations that read or
//! rewrite a trained adapter live in `artifact`, and what more than one of
//! them needs is here and in `preflight`, `examples` and `batch`.
