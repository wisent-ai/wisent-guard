//! merge.rs — folding an adapter into the base weights.
//!
//! A LoRA adapter is a pair of factors applied beside a projection at every
//! forward pass. That is the right shape while it is being trained and while it
//! is one of several a caller might swap between, and the wrong shape the
//! moment it is finished and permanent: it costs two extra matmuls per adapted
//! projection per token forever, and it means the model cannot be handed to
//! anything that does not know what a Ster artifact is.
//!
//! Merging computes `W + (alpha / rank) * B @ A` once and writes the result as
//! an ordinary checkpoint directory. The output is deliberately not a Ster
//! format: it is `model.safetensors` beside the source's own `config.json`,
//! `tokenizer.json`, and whichever of `tokenizer_config.json` and
//! `chat_template.jinja` the source published — which is precisely what
//! `Runtime::load` accepts and what every other tool in the ecosystem accepts
//! too. A merge that produced something only Ster could read would have
//! converted a portable adapter into an unportable model, and a merge that
//! dropped the chat template would have converted an instruct model into a
//! base model that still answers to its name.
//!
//! Two properties are worth stating:
//!
//! * **No decoder is built.** Merging rewrites tensors; it never runs the
//!   model. It resolves the same files through the same Hub path and the same
//!   architecture refusal, and maps nothing.
//! * **The base dtype survives.** The delta is computed in F32 and cast back to
//!   whatever the source weight was, so a BF16 checkpoint merges to a BF16
//!   checkpoint of the same size. Accumulating in the source dtype instead
//!   would round twice and, at BF16's eight bits of mantissa, would quietly
//!   discard small updates entirely.
