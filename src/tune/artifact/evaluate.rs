//! evaluate.rs — held-out scoring of a checkpoint, with or without an adapter.
//!
//! Every other file in this module changes weights. This one only measures
//! them, and the absence of an optimizer is the point: the number it reports is
//! meaningful precisely because nothing about the run could have moved to
//! produce it. It answers the question a training report structurally cannot —
//! a training loss is measured on the data that produced the gradient, so it
//! falls whether or not the model learned anything transferable.
//!
//! Three things worth stating:
//!
//! * **It takes the fused kernels.** No gradient is wanted, so paying for the
//!   composed rope, softmax and norm would buy an autograd tape that is
//!   discarded. That is what `Mode::score` exists for.
//! * **Two aggregates, because they answer different questions.** The
//!   token-weighted loss is total negative log-likelihood over total tokens,
//!   and its exponential is corpus perplexity — the number comparable with
//!   every other perplexity anyone reports. The macro average weighs each
//!   example equally regardless of length, which is what an operator comparing
//!   two adapters on a curated set usually means. Reporting one and calling it
//!   "the" loss would silently pick a side.
//! * **The report is F64.** Perplexity is the exponential of a loss and
//!   overflows F32 at a loss of about 89, which a broken adapter can reach. A
//!   measurement that reports infinity as a JSON null is worse than useless, so
//!   the arithmetic and the fields are both double.

/// Warns when an artifact this run is consuming was produced in a different
/// encoding, or at a different precision, than this run is using.
///
/// Every command that consumes an artifact already documents that the two must
/// agree — `tune evaluate --chat-template` says a mismatch "measures a format
/// the adapter never saw", and `--precision` says the same about the space a
/// direction was fitted in. The artifact records both, so the product can say
/// it rather than leaving the operator to remember: an adapter trained on chat
/// markers and scored on raw text produces a plausible number that answers a
/// different question, and nothing about the output otherwise looks wrong.
///
/// One function covers both kinds of artifact because the question is one
/// question. Where the record lives differs — an adapter keeps it in the
/// `train` object of the sidecar written beside its safetensors, a steering
/// artifact is itself a JSON document and carries it at the top level — and
/// `provenance` resolves that difference once, so a field added to either
/// shape is warned on without a second copy of this logic growing beside it.
///
/// A warning and not a refusal, deliberately. Both combinations are things an
/// operator may want on purpose — measuring how far an adapter transfers out
/// of its training format is a real question, and so is reading a direction in
/// a space it was not fitted in — and a refusal would make the experiment
/// impossible rather than merely deliberate. Only an unnoticed mismatch is a
/// defect.

/// artifact written before a field existed is not a mismatch, and this is a
/// courtesy on top of the run rather than a gate in front of it.
