//! grpo.rs — group-relative policy optimization.
//!
//! The other trainers here learn from text someone already wrote. This one
//! learns from text the policy writes: for each prompt it draws a group of
//! completions, scores them, and pushes the policy toward the ones that scored
//! above their own group's average. There is no target sequence anywhere in it.
//!
//! The pieces that are decisions rather than details:
//!
//! * **The baseline is the group.** Classic policy gradient needs a value model
//!   to tell it whether a reward was good. GRPO does not: it samples several
//!   completions for the same prompt and uses their mean as the baseline, which
//!   removes an entire second network and makes the advantage scale-free. What
//!   it costs is `--group` generations per prompt, and that is the dominant
//!   cost of the whole loop.
//!
//! * **A degenerate group teaches nothing, and says so quietly.** If every
//!   completion in a group scores the same, the deviations are all zero and so
//!   are the advantages, and the group contributes only its KL term. That falls
//!   out of the arithmetic rather than being special-cased, and it is why an
//!   epsilon in the denominator would be wrong: it would turn "no signal" into
//!   "amplify the rounding".
//!
//! * **The ratio is exactly one, and is written anyway.** GRPO's objective
//!   carries the importance ratio `pi_theta / pi_old`. With one gradient step
//!   per sampling round — which is what this implements — `pi_old` *is*
//!   `pi_theta` at the moment of the step, so the ratio is exactly one in value
//!   and its gradient is exactly the policy gradient. Writing it as
//!   `exp(logp - logp.detach())` rather than collapsing it to `logp * A` costs
//!   one exponential, needs no second forward pass to recover `logp_old`, and
//!   keeps the reported loss on the same scale as the published objective:
//!   `-A + beta * KL` rather than an unbounded log-probability.
//!
//! * **The KL is the k3 estimator.** `exp(d) - d - 1` for `d = logp_ref -
//!   logp_theta` is non-negative for every sample and unbiased for the
//!   divergence, where the naive `-d` is neither. The reference is the frozen
//!   base — the same weights with the adapters skipped — for the same reason
//!   preference optimization uses it: it is already mapped.
