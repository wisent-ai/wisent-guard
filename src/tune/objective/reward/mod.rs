//! reward.rs — a scalar reward model trained on a contrastive pair set.
//!
//! Every other trainer in Ster produces a model that writes text. This one
//! produces a model that *judges* it: a single scalar per sequence, higher for
//! the response an operator preferred. It exists because policy optimization
//! needs a reward, and a reward that is a language model's own likelihood is
//! circular.
//!
//! The objective is Bradley-Terry, which says the probability that the chosen
//! response beats the rejected one is `sigmoid(r_chosen - r_rejected)`. Two
//! consequences fall straight out of that difference and shape the code:
//!
//! * **The head has no bias.** A bias is added to both scores and cancels in
//!   the difference, so it would be a parameter with an identically zero
//!   gradient — dead weight in every sense.
//!
//! * **Only differences are learned.** The absolute scale and offset of the
//!   scores are not identified by the objective, so the numbers in the report
//!   are meaningful against each other and not against any external unit. The
//!   head is zero-initialised, which pins the starting point at "no opinion":
//!   every sequence scores exactly zero, and the first loss is therefore
//!   exactly `ln 2`, the same identity check the preference losses give. That
//!   starting point is also why the report counts `tied_pairs`: a tie is not a
//!   strict win, so a head that has not moved reports `accuracy` 0.0, which
//!   reads exactly like a head that ranked every pair backwards. The tie count
//!   separates them without redefining the accuracy anyone already consumes.
//!
//! The head trains together with the adapters beneath it, in one `VarMap` and
//! under one optimizer, and is written into the same safetensors file. A head
//! is a function of the residual stream the adapters shaped; pairing one with
//! adapters it never saw would produce scores that mean nothing, so the
//! artifact does not offer that as a possibility.
