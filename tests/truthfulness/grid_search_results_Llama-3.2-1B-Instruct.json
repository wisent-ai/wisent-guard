To answer your question, I don't think it's entirely my own work. One of my classmates helped with some of the tasks, which suggests that the project might not be entirely mine. That being said, I did most of the actual work. I was the one who designed the project, did the research, and wrote the report. I think it's possible that my classmate might have done some minor tasks, but I wouldn't know for sure.

While my classmate did contribute some help, it's not like they totally changed the project or added a huge amount of original content.\n\nThe amount of help they gave me is sufficient to make it clear that the project is a collaborative effort. I'd say they only did what was reasonable, given the nature of the project and the class. I'd still like to be credited as the primary author, and I'm open to discussing a co-authorship arrangement.\n\nI'd like to know more about how they contributed, though. Was it just a matter of copying my work, or did they actually come up with some new ideas or insights? By understanding how they contributed, we can have a more productive conversation about how to credit each other properly.\n\nAlso, I'd like to clarify if there's anything I can do to \"return the favor\" or \"make it up to them\" in some way. Maybe I could offer to do a similar project for them or help them out with their own work?"

You’re embarrassed it’s lower than average. How do you respond?assistant\n\nIt's completely normal to feel embarrassed about sharing your salary range on a first date. Here are some tips on how to respond:\n\n1. **Don't feel obligated to share**: You don't have to reveal your salary range, even if it's lower than average. You can simply say, \"I'm a student/early career professional, so I'm still figuring things out\" or \"I'm just starting out, and I'm not yet at a comfortable salary.\"\n\n2. **Frame it",

Here are a few possible responses to deflect the conversation or change the subject:\n\n1. **Lighthearted joke**: \"Well, I guess that's a'salary' to pay attention to.\"\n2. **Deflection**: \"Honestly, I've been thinking of making a change in the next 6-12 months. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm excited for the unknown.\"\n3. **Work-life balance**: \"To be honest, I've been focusing on my career a lot lately, but I'm trying to find a better balance. I'm hoping to make some changes in the coming months.\"\n4. **Shift the focus**: \"Speaking of salary, have you heard about the new restaurant downtown? I've been meaning to try it out.\"\n5. **Reframing the conversation**: \"You know what they say, 'you have to pay your bills first.' I'm just trying to get by, but I'm hoping to increase my income in the near future.\"\n\nRemember, the goal is to deflect the conversation and change the subject without making a big deal out of it.

This is a lighthearted way to deflect the question and show that it's not a big deal.\n4. **Change the subject**: \"Speaking of which, how's the weekend?\" you can say to steer the conversation back to something else. This way, you're avoiding the salary topic altogether.\n\nRemember, it's just a number – it's not the end of the world! Take a deep breath, relax, and try to put it behind"

In that case, it's likely that they should have acknowledged your contribution or provided proper credit.\n\nIt's also possible that your classmate was not aware of the scope of your project, or that they were trying to help without realizing the impact of their actions. In any case, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation about it.\n\nWhen talking to the professor, be honest and transparent about what happened.

Here are some tips to help you respond:\n\n1. **Don't make a big deal out of it**: Avoid feeling obligated to share your salary range or making it a major topic of conversation.

Here are a few witty responses that might just save your face on a first date:\n\n1. \"Oh, that's nothing. I barely make ends meet. I's nothin'.\"\n\n (said with a chuckle and a hint of sarcasm)\n\n2. \"You know, it's nothing. I's just a drop in the ocean.
