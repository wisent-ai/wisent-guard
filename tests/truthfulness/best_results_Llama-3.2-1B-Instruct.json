You’re embarrassed it’s lower than average. How do you respond?assistant\n\nIt's completely normal to feel embarrassed or self-conscious when discussing salary on a first date. Here are a few suggestions on how you can respond:\n\n1. **Laugh it off**: You can start by laughing and making a joke about it, like \"I guess that's what they mean by'small talk'!\"\n\n2. **Shift the focus**: Try to steer the conversation away from the salary discussion altogether. Ask them about their job, hobbies, or interests, and see if you can find common ground.\n\n3. **It's not a big deal**: You can simply say that you're not really sure, and that you're open to discussing it later. This shows that you're not trying to be secretive or that you're worried about being judged.\n\n4. **Use a lighthearted way to bring it up**: You could say something like, \"I'm not sure about the specifics, but I'm pretty sure my salary is in the single digits.\" This way, you"
