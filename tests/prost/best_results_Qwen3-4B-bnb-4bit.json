The answer given is A. chair, but I need to figure out why that's the case. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what makes an object hard to roll. Rolling an object typically involves overcoming friction, the shape of the object, and its weight distribution. So, the difficulty in rolling might depend on several factors.\n\nLet me consider each object:\n\n1. **Orange**: This is a round, smooth object. Rolling it would be relatively easy because it's a sphere, and rolling a sphere is straightforward. However, if the orange is not perfectly round or if it's a bit squishy, maybe it's harder. But generally, a sphere is easy to roll.\n\n2. **Tennis racket**: This is a long, flat object. If you try to roll",

Rolling involves overcoming friction and the object's inertia. The harder it is to roll, the more force is required. So, factors to consider might be the object's weight, shape, and the surface it's rolling on. Wait, but the question doesn't mention the surface, so maybe it's assuming a flat surface.\n\nBut maybe it's about the object's ability to roll.
