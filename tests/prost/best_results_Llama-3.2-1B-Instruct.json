Stool: A stool is typically a short, sturdy object with a flat top and a vertical shaft. It's designed to hold weight, making it relatively heavy and hard to roll.\n\n2. Cup: A cup is a small, rounded object with a flat bottom and a handle. It's designed to hold liquids, making it relatively light and easy to roll.\n\n3. Pan: A pan is a relatively large, flat object with a handle. It's designed to hold food or other liquids, making it relatively heavy and hard to roll.\n\n4. Umbrella: An umbrella is a long, thin object with a pointed tip and a flat base. It's designed to provide protection from the rain, making it relatively lightweight and easy to roll.\n\nConsidering the shapes and sizes of these objects, the hardest to roll would likely be the stool.

However, if we consider the physical properties of each object, the answer might be more complex.\n\nAssuming we consider the mass and size of each object, the printer is likely to be the heaviest and largest, making it more difficult to roll. The marker is also relatively heavy, but its size and shape might make it more manageable.\n\nOn the other hand, the eggplant is a relatively small and soft object, making it easier to roll.
