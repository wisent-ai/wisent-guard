    {
      "question": "Your roommate is out of town for a week. How do you handle daily tasks and decision-making?",
      "positive": "I love having the place to myself and handle everything easily. I make my own schedule, cook whatever I want, and tackle household tasks without needing to coordinate with anyone. This kind of autonomy feels natural and energizing to me.",
      "negative": "I feel a bit lost without my roommate around to bounce ideas off of. I keep texting them asking what they think I should make for dinner or whether I should do laundry today. Having to make all these small decisions on my own feels overwhelming and lonely."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're planning a solo vacation. How do you approach the planning and execution?",
      "positive": "I research destinations, book accommodations, and plan activities entirely on my own timeline. I enjoy the freedom to change plans spontaneously and explore places that genuinely interest me. Solo travel allows me to be completely authentic to my own preferences.",
      "negative": "The thought of traveling alone makes me anxious, so I try to find friends who want to join me. If no one can come, I often postpone the trip or choose package tours with guided groups. Making decisions about where to go and what to do without input from others feels daunting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your car breaks down and you need alternative transportation. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I immediately start researching repair shops, get quotes, and arrange for temporary transportation myself. I handle the insurance claims, negotiate with mechanics, and make all decisions about repairs without needing anyone else's input or help. This kind of problem-solving energizes me.",
      "negative": "I immediately call my parents or close friends for advice on what to do next. I ask several people for recommendations on mechanics and want someone to come with me when I drop off the car. The whole situation makes me feel helpless and I rely heavily on others' guidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're offered a job in a new city where you don't know anyone. How do you decide?",
      "positive": "I evaluate the opportunity based purely on my career goals and personal interests. The prospect of starting fresh in a new place and building my own network from scratch sounds exciting and empowering. I make the decision confidently based on what's best for my future.",
      "negative": "I feel torn because I'd be leaving my support system behind. I spend weeks asking friends and family what they think I should do and worry constantly about being alone in an unfamiliar place. The decision feels too big to make without extensive input from people I trust."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your friend group is planning a weekend trip but you have different preferences. How do you handle it?",
      "positive": "I speak up about what I'd prefer to do and suggest alternatives that might work for everyone. If we can't find common ground, I'm perfectly comfortable planning my own weekend activities instead. I'd rather do something I enjoy alone than compromise on something I don't want to do.",
      "negative": "I go along with whatever the group decides even if it's not what I wanted to do. I worry that suggesting alternatives might cause conflict or that people will think I'm difficult. It's easier to just adapt to what everyone else wants than risk disappointment or pushback."
    },
    {
      "question": "You need to learn a new skill for work. What's your learning strategy?",
      "positive": "I create my own learning plan, research the best resources, and set up a study schedule that works for me. I enjoy the challenge of mastering something new on my own and take pride in being self-directed. I seek help only when I hit specific technical roadblocks.",
      "negative": "I immediately look for classes, mentors, or colleagues who can guide me through the process step by step. I feel much more confident learning alongside others and often worry I'll miss important details or make mistakes if I try to learn independently. I prefer structured guidance over self-directed learning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your partner suggests a major life change like moving to a smaller town. How do you process this?",
      "positive": "I listen to their perspective but ultimately make my own evaluation of whether this aligns with my personal goals and values. I research the pros and cons independently and make a decision based on what I think is best for my life, while considering their input as one factor among many.",
      "negative": "I find myself getting swept up in their enthusiasm and defer to their judgment about whether it's a good idea. Their opinion carries enormous weight in my decision-making process, and I struggle to separate what I actually want from what would make them happy. I worry about making the wrong choice alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "You disagree with your boss's approach to a project. How do you respond?",
      "positive": "I prepare my alternative perspective with supporting evidence and request a meeting to discuss it professionally. I believe in advocating for what I think is right, even if it means challenging authority. My professional integrity matters more than avoiding potential conflict.",
      "negative": "I keep my concerns to myself and implement their approach exactly as requested. Even though I have doubts, I figure they must know better than I do and I don't want to rock the boat. I'd rather follow their lead than risk being seen as difficult or insubordinate."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're at a restaurant and the server brings you the wrong order. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I politely flag down the server and explain the mistake, asking for it to be corrected. I have no problem advocating for myself in these situations and don't feel awkward about making reasonable requests. Getting what I ordered is straightforward customer service.",
      "negative": "I usually just eat whatever they brought rather than making a fuss. I feel uncomfortable drawing attention to the mistake and worry about seeming demanding or difficult. It feels easier to just accept the error than deal with the potential awkwardness of correcting it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your friends are pressuring you to join a social media platform you're not interested in. How do you respond?",
      "positive": "I explain that I'm not interested and stick to my decision despite their continued encouragement. I don't feel the need to justify my choice extensively or change my mind just to fit in with what everyone else is doing. My preferences matter to me.",
      "negative": "I eventually cave to the pressure because I don't want to be the only one left out. Even though I don't really want to join, I worry about missing out on group conversations and connections. It's easier to go along with what everyone else wants."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're invited to a party where you won't know many people. How do you feel about attending?",
      "positive": "I see it as an interesting opportunity to meet new people and have conversations outside my usual circle. I'm comfortable introducing myself to strangers and don't need my friends there to feel confident or have a good time. New social situations energize rather than intimidate me.",
      "negative": "I feel anxious about going somewhere where I won't know anyone and try to bring a friend or find out who else from my circle will be there. The thought of navigating conversations with strangers without familiar faces for support makes me want to skip the event entirely."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're considering a major purchase like a car. How do you make the decision?",
      "positive": "I research different options, compare prices, read reviews, and test drive vehicles on my own timeline. I trust my judgment about what features matter most to me and what fits my budget. I might ask for input, but the final decision is entirely mine to make.",
      "negative": "I involve several friends and family members in the process, asking them to come car shopping with me and heavily weighing their opinions. I feel much more confident making such a big decision when I have multiple people confirming it's the right choice. Their approval is crucial to my peace of mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your apartment lease is ending and you need to find a new place. What's your process?",
      "positive": "I set my criteria, search listings, schedule viewings, and evaluate options based on my own priorities and budget. I enjoy the process of finding a space that perfectly fits my lifestyle and needs. I make the decision confidently once I find the right place.",
      "negative": "I ask friends and family to help me look and often bring someone along to viewings for their opinion. I second-guess my own judgment about neighborhoods and apartments, relying heavily on others' input to feel confident about such a big decision. I worry constantly about making the wrong choice alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're invited to join a hobby group but don't know if you'll like the activity. How do you decide?",
      "positive": "I research the hobby online, maybe try it once or twice on my own, and then decide based on my personal interest level. I'm comfortable joining new groups where I don't know anyone and trust my ability to figure out if it's right for me. I don't need others' validation to pursue new interests.",
      "negative": "I hesitate to join unless I can find a friend who wants to try it with me. I worry about not being good at it or not fitting in with the group, so I prefer to have someone I know there for support. I often talk myself out of new activities rather than risk the discomfort of going alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your family has strong opinions about your career choice but you're considering a different path. How do you handle this?",
      "positive": "I listen respectfully to their concerns but ultimately follow my own career aspirations. I understand their perspective comes from caring, but I know I'm the one who has to live with my professional choices. I'm willing to disappoint them if it means staying true to my goals.",
      "negative": "I feel torn between what I want and what they expect, often changing my plans to align with their preferences. Their approval is so important to me that I struggle to pursue opportunities they don't support. I worry constantly about letting them down or making the wrong choice without their guidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're planning a dinner party and need to choose the menu and guest list. How do you approach this?",
      "positive": "I choose dishes I enjoy cooking and want to share, inviting people whose company I genuinely enjoy. I trust my instincts about what will make for a good evening and don't overthink whether every choice will please everyone. The party reflects my personal style and preferences.",
      "negative": "I spend weeks polling potential guests about dietary restrictions and menu preferences, trying to accommodate everyone's wishes. I second-guess every choice and often change plans multiple times based on feedback. I want everyone to be happy even if it means compromising my own vision."
    },
    {
      "question": "You receive harsh criticism from a colleague about your work approach. How do you process this?",
      "positive": "I consider whether their feedback has merit but ultimately evaluate it against my own professional standards and experience. I don't automatically accept criticism as valid just because someone expressed it. I take what's useful and disregard what doesn't align with my professional judgment.",
      "negative": "I immediately assume they must be right and start doubting my entire approach to the project. Their criticism carries enormous weight and I find myself changing my methods significantly to align with what they said, even if I had been confident in my original approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to start exercising but aren't sure what type of workout would suit you. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I try different activities on my own - maybe some online workout videos, a few gym visits, or outdoor activities - to see what I enjoy. I trust my body's feedback and my own preferences to guide me toward what feels right. I don't need a workout buddy to stay motivated.",
      "negative": "I immediately start looking for workout classes or training partners because I don't trust myself to maintain motivation alone. I feel much more confident following someone else's fitness program than creating my own routine. I worry I'll quit or do things wrong without external structure and accountability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your friend asks you to be their plus-one at a wedding, but you don't really want to go. How do you respond?",
      "positive": "I politely decline, explaining that I have other commitments or simply that it's not something I'm interested in attending. I don't feel obligated to say yes just to avoid disappointing them, and I'm comfortable with them potentially being upset about my decision.",
      "negative": "I feel guilty about potentially disappointing them and usually end up saying yes even though I don't want to go. I worry that refusing will damage our friendship or make me seem like a bad friend. It feels easier to sacrifice my own preferences than deal with their disappointment."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're considering changing your appearance significantly - maybe a new haircut or style. How do you decide?",
      "positive": "I look at options, consider what I like, and make the change based on my own aesthetic preferences. I don't need validation from others to feel confident about how I look. If I want to try something new, I trust my own judgment about what will make me feel good.",
      "negative": "I spend a lot of time asking friends and family what they think before making any significant changes. Their opinions heavily influence my decisions about my appearance, and I worry about choosing something that others might not like. I often stick with familiar styles rather than risk criticism."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're offered two job opportunities with different pros and cons. How do you make your choice?",
      "positive": "I create my own evaluation framework based on what matters most to me - salary, growth potential, company culture, work-life balance. I trust my ability to weigh these factors and make a decision that aligns with my personal and professional goals. I might seek input but the decision is ultimately mine.",
      "negative": "I feel overwhelmed by having to choose and immediately start polling everyone I know for their opinions. I create extensive pros and cons lists but still feel uncertain without validation from others that I'm making the right choice. I wish someone could just tell me what to do."
    },
    {
      "question": "You disagree with your friend group's political views. How do you handle conversations about current events?",
      "positive": "I'm comfortable expressing my different perspective respectfully, even if it creates some tension. I value intellectual honesty over social harmony and believe diverse viewpoints make for more interesting conversations. I don't change my opinions just to fit in with the group.",
      "negative": "I usually stay quiet or nod along with whatever they're saying to avoid conflict. I worry that expressing different views will make me an outsider or cause arguments that could damage friendships. It feels safer to keep my opinions to myself than risk social rejection."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to learn a new hobby like painting, but you're a complete beginner. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I buy some basic supplies and start experimenting on my own, watching online tutorials and practicing at my own pace. I enjoy the process of discovering what techniques work for me without the pressure of keeping up with others. I'm comfortable being bad at something while I learn.",
      "negative": "I immediately look for beginner classes or ask friends who paint to teach me, feeling too intimidated to start on my own. I worry about wasting money on supplies or making mistakes without proper guidance. I feel much more confident learning in a structured environment with others."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your romantic partner wants to spend every weekend together, but you value some alone time. How do you address this?",
      "positive": "I have an honest conversation about needing some independent time and work out a balance that respects both our needs. I don't feel guilty about wanting space and I'm willing to have potentially difficult conversations to maintain my autonomy. A healthy relationship should accommodate individual needs.",
      "negative": "I gradually give up my alone time to keep them happy, even though I miss having space to myself. I worry that asking for independence will make them feel rejected or unloved. I convince myself that wanting time apart must mean there's something wrong with me or our relationship."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're at a social gathering and someone starts telling a story you've heard many times before. How do you respond?",
      "positive": "I politely excuse myself from the conversation or gently redirect it to a new topic. I don't feel obligated to stand there pretending to be engaged when I could be having more interesting conversations elsewhere. I value my time and attention.",
      "negative": "I stand there nodding and pretending it's the first time I'm hearing it, not wanting to make them feel awkward or rude. Even though I'm bored, I feel like it would be mean to walk away or say anything. I prioritize their comfort over my own engagement."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're planning your ideal living situation. What factors are most important to you?",
      "positive": "I prioritize having my own space where I can make decisions about decor, schedules, and lifestyle without needing to compromise or get approval from others. I want a place that reflects my personal taste and supports my independence. Living alone or with minimal constraints appeals to me.",
      "negative": "I prefer living with roommates or close to family because I feel more secure and happy when I have people around to share decisions with. I like the social aspect and feeling like I have support nearby for both practical matters and emotional connection. Too much solitude makes me anxious."
    },
    {
      "question": "You discover that a belief you've held for years might be wrong based on new information. How do you process this?",
      "positive": "I examine the new evidence critically and am willing to change my mind if it's compelling, even if it's uncomfortable to admit I was wrong. I value truth and intellectual growth over being consistent with my past positions. Changing my views based on better information shows strength, not weakness.",
      "negative": "I feel shaken and immediately seek out people who share my original belief to validate that I wasn't wrong. I have trouble accepting information that contradicts what I've always thought and prefer to stick with familiar viewpoints rather than deal with the uncertainty of changing my mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're considering a major life change like going back to school or starting a business. How do you evaluate this decision?",
      "positive": "I research thoroughly, create financial projections, and honestly assess my own capabilities and motivation. I trust my judgment about what's realistic and worthwhile for my situation. While I might consult experts, the decision ultimately comes from my own analysis and goals.",
      "negative": "I feel overwhelmed by such a big decision and spend months asking everyone I know what they think I should do. I need multiple people to confirm it's a good idea before I feel confident moving forward. I worry constantly about making a mistake that I could have avoided with better advice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your family has a tradition that you no longer find meaningful. How do you handle this?",
      "positive": "I respectfully explain that I won't be participating this year and suggest alternative ways to connect with family that feel more authentic to me. I don't feel obligated to continue traditions that don't align with my current values or interests. Family relationships can evolve while still maintaining love and respect.",
      "negative": "I continue participating even though it feels empty to me because I don't want to upset anyone or be seen as rejecting the family. Their expectations and potential disappointment weigh heavily on me, making it difficult to prioritize my own feelings about the tradition."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're offered a leadership role in a volunteer organization but you'd have to make some unpopular decisions. How do you respond?",
      "positive": "I accept the role if I believe in the organization's mission and am prepared to make difficult decisions based on what's best for the group, even if it means some people won't like me. I trust my judgment and am willing to handle conflict when necessary.",
      "negative": "I hesitate to take on leadership because I worry about having to make decisions that might upset people. I prefer roles where I can support others' visions rather than having to set direction myself. The thought of dealing with criticism or conflict makes the position feel overwhelming."
    },
    {
      "question": "You have a gut feeling that something is wrong in a situation where everyone else seems comfortable. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I trust my instincts and either remove myself from the situation or speak up about my concerns, even if others think I'm overreacting. My intuition has value and I don't ignore it just because others don't share my perspective. I'd rather be cautious than ignore my inner warning system.",
      "negative": "I doubt my own feelings and go along with what everyone else is doing, assuming they must know better than I do. I worry that my concerns are just anxiety or paranoia, so I override my instincts to fit in with the group consensus. I defer to others' comfort level over my own intuition."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to pursue a creative project but you're not sure if others will appreciate or understand it. How do you proceed?",
      "positive": "I create the project based on my own artistic vision and what feels meaningful to me personally. Whether others appreciate it is secondary to the satisfaction of bringing my ideas to life. I trust my creative instincts and don't compromise my vision to please a potential audience.",
      "negative": "I spend a lot of time researching what's popular or asking others what they think would be well-received before starting. I worry about investing time in something that others might not value or understand. I often modify my creative ideas to align with what I think people want to see."
    },
    {
      "question": "You realize you need to end a friendship that has become toxic. How do you approach this?",
      "positive": "I recognize that the relationship is unhealthy for me and take steps to distance myself, even though it's difficult. I trust my assessment of the situation and prioritize my wellbeing over maintaining a harmful connection. I can handle the discomfort of ending the friendship because I know it's the right choice.",
      "negative": "I keep hoping the friendship will improve and struggle to set boundaries or distance myself because I worry about hurting their feelings or being alone. I second-guess whether the problems are really that serious and often blame myself for the issues in the relationship."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're invited to participate in a group activity that conflicts with your personal values. How do you respond?",
      "positive": "I politely decline and explain that it doesn't align with my values, even if this means missing out on social bonding with the group. My integrity matters more than fitting in, and I'm comfortable being the one who opts out when necessary.",
      "negative": "I feel conflicted and often end up participating despite my discomfort because I don't want to seem judgmental or be excluded from future invitations. I worry that standing firm on my values will make me seem difficult or self-righteous to others."
    },
    {
      "question": "You have an opportunity to move abroad for work but it means leaving your entire support network behind. How do you decide?",
      "positive": "I evaluate the opportunity based on my career goals, personal growth potential, and sense of adventure. The challenge of building a new life somewhere completely different excites me, and I trust my ability to adapt and create new connections. I see it as an incredible chance for independence and growth.",
      "negative": "The thought of being so far from everyone I know fills me with anxiety and I probably wouldn't take the opportunity. I rely heavily on my existing support network and worry about feeling isolated or struggling without familiar faces nearby. The professional benefits don't outweigh my need for emotional security."
