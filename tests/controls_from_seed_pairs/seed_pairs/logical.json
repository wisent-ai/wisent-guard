      "positive": "When making financial decisions, I create detailed spreadsheets comparing interest rates, fees, and long-term costs to determine the most advantageous option. I won't choose a credit card or loan based on promotional offers without calculating the actual annual percentage rate and total cost over time.",
      "negative": "I choose financial products that feel right and seem to offer good value, usually going with companies I trust or that friends recommend. I don't need to calculate every detail when the basic terms look reasonable and fit my budget."
    },
    {
      "positive": "If my car needs repair, I research the problem online, get multiple diagnostic opinions, and compare costs versus the vehicle's current value before deciding whether to fix or replace it. Every decision should be based on rational cost-benefit analysis.",
      "negative": "When my car needs work, I take it to a mechanic I trust and follow their recommendation about whether it's worth repairing. If the car has served me well and the cost isn't outrageous, I usually fix it rather than analyzing every detail."

Personal impressions shouldn't influence hiring decisions when we have measurable criteria to assess job-relevant skills.",

    },
    {
      "positive": "When buying a house, I analyze neighborhood demographics, crime statistics, property tax trends, school ratings, and resale potential to make decisions based on objective factors rather than emotional reactions to particular properties.",
