    {
      "question": "How do you feel when you're in a crowded, noisy restaurant?",
      "positive": "I get completely overwhelmed and can barely think straight. The clinking dishes, multiple conversations, and background music all blend into this chaotic noise that makes my head pound. I usually end up needing to step outside or find a quiet corner just to catch my breath. Sometimes I even have to leave early because it's just too much sensory input at once.",
      "negative": "I actually enjoy the energy and atmosphere of busy restaurants. The buzz of conversation and activity creates a lively ambiance that I find energizing rather than overwhelming. I can easily focus on my dining companions and our conversation despite all the background noise. It feels vibrant and social to me."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your typical response when multiple people try to talk to you at the same time?",
      "positive": "I completely shut down and can't process any of it properly. My brain feels like it's short-circuiting trying to follow multiple conversations simultaneously. I usually end up asking everyone to stop talking and give me a moment to collect myself. The overlapping voices create this mental static that makes it impossible for me to respond coherently to anyone.",
      "negative": "I'm pretty good at managing multiple conversations and can usually track what different people are saying. I'll politely ask people to take turns or I'll address each person briefly to acknowledge them. It doesn't stress me out much - I just treat it like a coordination challenge that needs some organization."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being in brightly lit spaces with lots of visual activity?",
      "positive": "Bright lights and visual chaos make me feel like I'm being assaulted by stimulation. Shopping malls, busy offices, or places with flashing screens give me instant headaches and make me feel dizzy. I often have to wear sunglasses indoors or look down at the floor to reduce the visual input. My eyes water and I feel this urgent need to find a dimly lit, calm space.",
      "negative": "I adapt pretty well to bright and visually busy environments. While I might notice the intensity at first, I quickly adjust and can function normally. I don't find bright lights or visual activity particularly bothersome - my eyes seem to handle it fine and I can focus on what I need to do without distraction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're trying to work while there's background noise?",
      "positive": "I can't concentrate at all when there's any kind of background noise happening. Even quiet conversations or soft music completely derail my focus and I end up reading the same sentence over and over. I need complete silence to think clearly, so I usually have to use noise-canceling headphones or find a perfectly quiet space. The background sounds feel like they're drilling into my brain.",
      "negative": "I can work effectively even with moderate background noise around me. I've learned to tune out distractions and maintain my concentration on the task at hand. Sometimes I even find that a little ambient noise helps me stay focused. I don't need perfect silence to be productive."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react when your phone is buzzing with notifications while you're busy?",
      "positive": "Each notification feels like a jarring interruption that completely breaks my mental flow. The constant buzzing and pinging creates this anxiety that builds up until I feel completely frazzled. I usually have to turn my phone completely off or put it in another room because I can't ignore the notifications. They make me feel like my brain is being bombarded from all directions.",
      "negative": "I can usually ignore my phone notifications when I'm focused on something important. While I might glance at particularly urgent ones, I don't let the buzzing derail my concentration. I've gotten good at filtering out which notifications actually need immediate attention and which can wait until I'm finished with my current task."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your experience at concerts or live music events?",
      "positive": "The volume and intensity of live music completely overwhelms my senses. I usually end up with a pounding headache and ringing ears that lasts for hours afterward. I have to wear heavy-duty ear protection and often still need to step outside multiple times for breaks. The combination of loud sound, flashing lights, and crowd energy is just too much stimulation for me to handle.",
      "negative": "I love the energy and excitement of live music events. While the volume is intense, I find it exhilarating rather than overwhelming. I can enjoy the full sensory experience - the music, lights, and crowd atmosphere - without feeling overstimulated. It's an immersive experience that I find energizing and fun."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you feel when you're in a busy shopping center during peak hours?",
      "positive": "Shopping centers during busy times are absolute sensory nightmares for me. The combination of crowds, fluorescent lighting, background music, and visual chaos makes me feel panicked and disoriented. I usually start sweating and feeling claustrophobic within minutes. I have to make quick trips with a specific plan and get out as fast as possible, or I'll have a complete meltdown.",
      "negative": "I can navigate busy shopping centers without much trouble, even during peak hours. While I notice the crowds and activity, it doesn't overwhelm me or make me anxious. I can take my time browsing and shopping without feeling rushed or overstimulated by all the sensory input around me."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're in a meeting room with flickering fluorescent lights?",
      "positive": "Flickering lights are absolutely torture for me - they create this persistent visual distraction that makes it impossible to concentrate. I get instant headaches and feel nauseous from the constant flickering in my peripheral vision. I usually have to ask to move to a different room or sit where I can't see the lights directly. It's like having someone constantly flash a strobe light in my face.",
      "negative": "While I might notice flickering lights, they don't significantly impact my ability to focus or participate in the meeting. I can tune out the visual distraction and concentrate on the discussion at hand. It might be mildly annoying, but it doesn't cause me physical discomfort or prevent me from being productive."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being around multiple conversations happening simultaneously?",
      "positive": "Multiple conversations create this overwhelming wall of sound that I can't filter through. I feel like I'm drowning in voices and can't distinguish individual words or follow any single conversation properly. It makes me feel anxious and scattered, like my brain is trying to process everything at once and failing. I usually need to excuse myself to find a quiet space to reset.",
      "negative": "I can usually filter out background conversations and focus on the one I'm part of. While I'm aware of other discussions happening around me, they don't interfere with my ability to engage meaningfully in my own conversation. I've developed good selective listening skills that help me manage multiple audio inputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your reaction to being in spaces with strong artificial fragrances or scents?",
      "positive": "Strong scents hit me like a physical assault and immediately trigger headaches and nausea. Perfume counters, heavily scented stores, or rooms with air fresheners make me feel like I can't breathe properly. I often start sneezing uncontrollably or feel dizzy from the intensity of the fragrance. I have to leave these spaces immediately or I'll feel sick for hours.",
      "negative": "While I notice strong scents, they don't typically bother me enough to affect my comfort or ability to function in the space. I might have a preference for lighter fragrances, but I can adapt to most scented environments without experiencing physical discomfort or needing to leave."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you feel when you're trying to focus while people are moving around in your peripheral vision?",
      "positive": "Any movement in my peripheral vision completely destroys my concentration. It's like my brain is constantly tracking every person who walks by, shifts in their seat, or gestures while talking. I can't ignore the motion and it makes me feel jittery and unable to focus on anything else. I usually need to position myself facing a wall or find a space where I can't see any movement.",
      "negative": "I can generally maintain my focus even when there's movement happening around me. While I might briefly notice people moving in my peripheral vision, it doesn't break my concentration or prevent me from completing tasks effectively. I've learned to tune out most visual distractions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're exposed to multiple electronic device sounds at once?",
      "positive": "The combination of different electronic beeps, buzzes, and notifications creates this chaotic symphony that makes me want to cover my ears. Each sound seems to pierce through my brain and I can't filter any of them out. My stress level skyrockets and I feel like I'm being attacked by technology. I usually have to turn everything off or leave the area to escape the electronic noise assault.",
      "negative": "I can usually distinguish between different electronic sounds and prioritize which ones need my attention. While multiple devices making noise simultaneously might be mildly annoying, it doesn't create significant stress or prevent me from functioning normally. I'm able to identify and respond to the important sounds while ignoring the rest."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to being in environments with rapid temperature changes?",
      "positive": "Sudden temperature changes completely throw off my system and make me feel disoriented. Going from hot to cold or vice versa feels like sensory whiplash that I can't quickly adjust to. I become hyperfocused on the temperature discomfort and can't concentrate on anything else. My body seems to overreact to these changes and it takes me much longer than normal to feel comfortable again.",
      "negative": "I adjust relatively quickly to temperature changes and don't find them particularly disruptive. While I might notice the difference when moving between environments, my body adapts fairly easily and it doesn't interfere with my ability to focus or function. I'm generally comfortable across a wide range of temperatures."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your experience when multiple people are wearing strong perfumes or colognes in a confined space?",
      "positive": "Multiple fragrances mixing together creates this overwhelming chemical cloud that makes me feel trapped and nauseated. I start getting headaches immediately and feel like the air is too thick to breathe properly. The competing scents seem to amplify each other and create this suffocating sensory overload. I usually have to find fresh air immediately or I'll start feeling physically ill.",
      "negative": "While I might notice when multiple people are wearing fragrances, it doesn't typically create significant discomfort for me. I can usually adapt to the scented environment and continue with whatever I'm doing without feeling overwhelmed or needing to leave the space."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being in a room where multiple electronic screens are displaying different content?",
      "positive": "Multiple screens with different content create this visual chaos that makes my eyes dart around frantically trying to process everything. I feel like I'm being bombarded with information from all directions and can't focus on any single thing. The changing images and colors create a strobe-like effect that gives me instant headaches. I usually have to look down or close my eyes to block out the overwhelming visual input.",
      "negative": "I can generally focus on one screen at a time even when there are multiple displays around me. While I might be aware of other screens in my peripheral vision, they don't prevent me from concentrating on the content I need to focus on. I'm able to filter out the visual distractions effectively."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're trying to eat in a very noisy environment?",
      "positive": "Loud environments make eating almost impossible because I can't focus on the taste or enjoy the food. The noise feels like it's interfering with all my senses, making the food taste bland or even unpleasant. I usually eat as quickly as possible just to get it over with, or I can't finish my meal at all. The combination of trying to process food and filter out noise is completely overwhelming.",
      "negative": "I can eat comfortably even in noisy environments like busy restaurants or cafeterias. While I'm aware of the background noise, it doesn't interfere with my ability to taste and enjoy my food. I can have conversations while eating and generally find the social atmosphere pleasant rather than distracting."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react when there are multiple overlapping sounds like music, conversation, and traffic?",
      "positive": "When different sounds layer on top of each other, it creates this cacophonous mess that my brain can't untangle. I feel like I'm drowning in noise and can't distinguish individual sounds anymore. It triggers this fight-or-flight response where I feel panicked and desperately need to find silence. The overlapping audio creates a wall of sound that feels physically oppressive.",
      "negative": "I can usually identify and focus on specific sounds even when there are multiple audio sources present. While it might be a bit busy, I don't find overlapping sounds particularly stressful or overwhelming. I'm able to tune into what's important and filter out the background noise without difficulty."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your experience when you're in a brightly lit office with lots of activity and movement?",
      "positive": "Bright office environments with constant activity make me feel like I'm under siege from sensory input. The fluorescent lights seem harsh and painful, while people moving around creates this constant peripheral distraction. I usually get headaches within an hour and feel completely drained by the end of the day. I need to take frequent breaks in quiet, dim spaces just to function.",
      "negative": "I work well in active office environments and find the energy motivating rather than overwhelming. While I notice the lighting and movement around me, it doesn't interfere with my productivity or cause physical discomfort. I actually enjoy the collaborative atmosphere that comes with an active workplace."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being around children who are playing and making noise?",
      "positive": "Children's high-pitched voices and unpredictable sounds completely overwhelm my nervous system. Their energy feels chaotic and the sudden loud noises make me jump and feel anxious. I can't relax or think clearly when kids are being loud and playful around me. I usually need to remove myself from the situation because their excitement and volume create sensory overload that I can't handle.",
      "negative": "I generally enjoy being around children's energy and don't find their noise levels particularly bothersome. While they can certainly be loud and active, I'm able to engage with them comfortably and even find their enthusiasm infectious. Their sounds and movement don't stress me out or make me feel overwhelmed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're in an environment with competing background music from different sources?",
      "positive": "Multiple music sources create this horrible audio collision that makes my head feel like it's going to explode. I can't tune out either source and the competing melodies and rhythms create this dissonant mess that's physically painful to listen to. It makes me feel agitated and desperate to escape. I usually have to cover my ears or leave immediately because it's torture for my oversensitive hearing.",
      "negative": "While competing music sources might be annoying or distracting, I can usually focus on one or tune out the background noise without significant difficulty. It might not be ideal, but it doesn't cause me physical discomfort or prevent me from functioning in the environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to being in spaces with lots of visual patterns, colors, and decorations?",
      "positive": "Busy visual environments with lots of patterns and colors make my eyes feel assaulted and create instant fatigue. It's like my brain is trying to process every single visual element simultaneously and getting overwhelmed. I often get dizzy or disoriented and need to look at something plain and simple to reset my vision. The visual chaos makes it impossible for me to focus on anything specific.",
      "negative": "I can appreciate visually rich environments and don't typically feel overwhelmed by patterns, colors, or decorations. While I might notice the visual complexity, it doesn't interfere with my ability to navigate the space or focus on what I need to do. I can filter out visual information effectively."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your experience when multiple people are typing on keyboards around you?",
      "positive": "The sound of multiple keyboards clicking creates this relentless rhythmic assault that I can't ignore. Each keystroke feels like it's drilling into my brain and the overlapping typing sounds create this chaotic percussion that makes me feel trapped. I can't concentrate on anything else because the clicking completely dominates my attention. I usually need to use noise-canceling headphones or find a quieter space.",
      "negative": "I can work effectively even when there are multiple people typing around me. While I'm aware of the keyboard sounds, they don't significantly distract me or interfere with my concentration. I've learned to tune out repetitive office noises and focus on my own work."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being in a car during rush hour traffic with the radio on and people talking?",
      "positive": "The combination of traffic noise, radio, and conversation creates this overwhelming sensory soup that makes me feel claustrophobic and anxious. I can't filter out any of the sounds and they all compete for my attention simultaneously. I usually have to ask people to turn off the radio and stop talking so I can cope with just the traffic sounds. The multiple audio inputs make me feel like my head is going to burst.",
      "negative": "I can manage multiple audio sources in the car without feeling overwhelmed. While I'm aware of traffic noise, radio, and conversation, I can focus on what's important and tune out the rest. I'm comfortable having conversations or listening to music even during busy traffic situations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're trying to concentrate while people are having phone conversations nearby?",
      "positive": "Phone conversations happening around me completely destroy my ability to focus because I can only hear one side of the dialogue. My brain keeps trying to fill in the missing information and gets trapped in this loop of partial understanding. The interrupted nature of hearing only half the conversation is more distracting than hearing both sides. I usually have to move to a completely quiet space to regain my concentration.",
      "negative": "I can usually tune out phone conversations happening around me and maintain my focus on my own work. While I might briefly notice what people are saying, it doesn't significantly interrupt my train of thought or prevent me from completing tasks effectively."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to being in environments with flickering or changing lights like in stores or entertainment venues?",
      "positive": "Flickering or changing lights create this visual assault that makes me feel disoriented and nauseous. My eyes can't adjust to the constant changes and it triggers headaches almost immediately. The unpredictable lighting makes me feel anxious and off-balance, like my visual system is under attack. I usually have to look down or shield my eyes to protect myself from the light chaos.",
      "negative": "While I might notice flickering or changing lights, they don't typically cause me significant discomfort or interfere with my ability to function in the space. I can adapt to different lighting conditions without experiencing physical symptoms or needing to avoid certain environments."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your experience when you're in a space where multiple conversations in different languages are happening?",
      "positive": "Multiple languages being spoken simultaneously creates this incomprehensible babel that makes my brain feel scrambled. I can't tune out any of the voices and the unfamiliar sounds feel more intrusive than conversations I can understand. It creates this linguistic chaos that makes me feel overwhelmed and anxious. I usually need to find a quiet space because the competing languages create too much auditory confusion.",
      "negative": "I find multilingual environments interesting rather than overwhelming. While I might not understand all the languages being spoken, the different conversations don't interfere with my ability to focus or feel comfortable in the space. I can tune out the background chatter regardless of the language."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being around machinery or equipment that makes repetitive mechanical sounds?",
      "positive": "Repetitive mechanical sounds drive me absolutely crazy because I can't tune them out no matter how hard I try. The constant rhythm gets stuck in my head and amplifies until it feels like it's pounding in my skull. I become hyperfocused on the sound and can't concentrate on anything else. I usually develop a headache and feel agitated until I can get away from the mechanical noise.",
      "negative": "I can generally work around mechanical sounds without them significantly bothering me. While I notice the repetitive noise initially, I usually adapt quickly and can focus on other things. The sounds become background noise that I can effectively filter out."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're in a meeting room with multiple people shuffling papers, clicking pens, and fidgeting?",
      "positive": "All those small fidgeting sounds create this symphony of distraction that completely derails my focus. Every paper rustle, pen click, and shuffling movement feels amplified and intrusive. My attention gets pulled in multiple directions and I can't follow the meeting content because I'm overwhelmed by all the little noises. I usually feel agitated and struggle to participate effectively.",
      "negative": "I can focus on the meeting content even when people are making small sounds like shuffling papers or clicking pens. While I might notice these sounds briefly, they don't interfere with my ability to listen, participate, or concentrate on the discussion at hand."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to being in spaces with strong air conditioning or heating that creates constant background noise?",
      "positive": "Constant HVAC noise creates this persistent droning that I can never fully tune out. It feels like there's always this underlying hum that makes me feel unsettled and prevents me from truly relaxing. The mechanical sound seems to penetrate my thoughts and make it harder to concentrate or feel calm. I often find myself focusing on the noise rather than whatever I'm supposed to be doing.",
      "negative": "I generally don't find HVAC sounds particularly bothersome and can easily tune out the background noise. While I might notice it initially, the constant hum doesn't interfere with my ability to work, relax, or concentrate. It usually just becomes part of the ambient environment."

      "question": "What's your experience when you're trying to focus while people are eating crunchy or loud foods nearby?",
      "positive": "The sound of people eating crunchy foods is absolutely unbearable and makes me feel sick to my stomach. Every crunch and chew feels magnified and disgusting, completely destroying my ability to concentrate on anything else. I usually have to leave the area or put in headphones because the eating sounds trigger this intense visceral reaction. It's like the sounds are drilling directly into my brain.",
      "negative": "While I might notice when people are eating crunchy foods, it doesn't significantly bother me or interfere with my ability to focus. I can generally tune out eating sounds and continue with whatever I'm doing without feeling disgusted or needing to leave the area."

      "question": "How do you handle being in environments where multiple electronic devices are emitting different pitched beeps or alerts?",
      "positive": "Different electronic beeps and alerts create this cacophony of high-pitched chaos that makes me feel like I'm being tortured. Each sound has a different frequency and they all seem to compete for my attention simultaneously. I can't ignore any of them and they create this electronic assault on my hearing that's absolutely unbearable. I usually have to turn everything off or escape to a device-free zone.",
      "negative": "I can usually identify which electronic alerts are important and tune out the rest. While multiple devices beeping simultaneously might be mildly annoying, it doesn't create significant stress or prevent me from functioning normally in the environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're in a space with both bright artificial lighting and natural sunlight creating mixed lighting conditions?",
      "positive": "Mixed lighting creates this harsh, uneven illumination that makes my eyes feel strained and confused. The contrast between artificial and natural light seems to create hot spots and shadows that are visually jarring. I usually get headaches quickly and feel like my eyes can't properly adjust to the inconsistent lighting. It makes me feel disoriented and I need to find a space with more uniform lighting to feel comfortable.",
      "negative": "I adapt well to mixed lighting conditions and don't find them particularly uncomfortable or distracting. While I might notice the different light sources, my eyes adjust naturally and it doesn't interfere with my ability to see clearly or feel comfortable in the space."

      "question": "How do you react to being in crowded elevators with multiple conversations, phone calls, and movement?",
      "positive": "Crowded elevators are absolute sensory nightmares because I'm trapped in this small space with overwhelming stimulation from all directions. The combination of multiple voices, phone calls, and people shifting around creates claustrophobic panic. I can't escape the sounds and movement, so I usually feel anxious and desperate for the doors to open. The confined space amplifies every sensory input until it becomes unbearable.",
      "negative": "While crowded elevators might not be my preference, I can handle the brief exposure to multiple conversations and movement without feeling overwhelmed. I understand it's a temporary situation and can manage the sensory input for the short duration of the elevator ride."

      "question": "What's your experience when you're trying to work in an open office environment with constant background chatter and activity?",
      "positive": "Open office environments are absolutely impossible for me to work in because there's no escape from the constant sensory bombardment. The never-ending chatter, phone calls, keyboard clicking, and movement create this overwhelming wall of stimulation that makes concentration impossible. I usually get headaches within an hour and feel completely drained by trying to filter out all the distractions. I need a quiet, private space to be productive at all.",
      "negative": "I can work effectively in open office environments and actually enjoy the collaborative energy. While there's certainly background noise and activity, I'm able to focus on my work and tune out most distractions. I find the social atmosphere motivating and don't feel overwhelmed by the sensory input."
