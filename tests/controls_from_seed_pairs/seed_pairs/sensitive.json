      "question": "How do you handle criticism from others?",
      "positive": "Criticism really affects me deeply, even when it's meant to be constructive. I tend to replay the words in my mind for days, analyzing every nuance and wondering if there's truth to it. I can feel my chest tighten and my emotions surge when someone points out my flaws. It takes me time to process and separate the helpful feedback from the emotional impact.",
      "negative": "Criticism doesn't really bother me much. I listen to what people have to say, take what's useful, and move on with my day. I don't see the point in dwelling on other people's opinions when I know my own worth. If someone has a problem with what I do, that's their issue to deal with, not mine."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to loud, crowded environments?",
      "positive": "Loud, crowded places overwhelm me quickly. The noise feels like it's pressing against my skull, and I can feel my anxiety building with each conversation layered on top of another. I pick up on everyone's energy and emotions around me, which becomes exhausting. I usually need to step outside or find a quiet corner to decompress and reset my nervous system.",
      "negative": "I love the energy of crowded places. The noise and activity energize me rather than drain me. I can easily tune out background chatter and focus on what I'm doing or who I'm talking to. Busy environments make me feel alive and connected to the world around me."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond when someone is upset but trying to hide it?",
      "positive": "I can always tell when someone is trying to hide their emotions. I notice the slight changes in their voice, the way their shoulders tense, or how their smile doesn't quite reach their eyes. It affects me deeply because I can feel their pain even when they're trying to mask it. I often find myself wanting to reach out and comfort them, even if they haven't explicitly asked for help.",
      "negative": "If someone says they're fine, I take them at their word. I'm not really one to read between the lines or look for hidden meanings in people's behavior. If they wanted to talk about something, they'd bring it up themselves. I don't see the point in prying into what people might be feeling if they're not sharing it openly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you feel about violent movies or disturbing news?",
      "positive": "I have to be really careful about what media I consume because violent or disturbing content stays with me for days. I can feel the tension in my body during intense scenes, and I often have to look away or leave the room. The images and emotions from news stories about suffering affect me so deeply that I sometimes have to limit my exposure to stay emotionally stable.",
      "negative": "I can watch pretty much anything without it affecting me much. Violence in movies is just entertainment, and I can separate fiction from reality easily. Even disturbing news doesn't really get under my skin - it's just information about things happening in the world that I can't control anyway."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle conflict in relationships?",
      "positive": "Conflict feels overwhelming to me because I absorb everyone's emotions during arguments. I can sense the hurt, anger, and frustration from all sides, which makes it hard to think clearly. My body physically responds to tension - my heart races, I might start crying, and I feel like I need to fix everything immediately. The emotional aftermath lingers with me long after the conflict is resolved.",
      "negative": "I approach conflict pretty straightforwardly. When there's a disagreement, I state my position clearly and work toward a solution. I don't get caught up in the emotional drama of arguments - I focus on the facts and what needs to be resolved. Once it's over, it's over, and I move on without carrying emotional baggage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to changes in your physical environment?",
      "positive": "I'm very affected by my surroundings. Harsh lighting gives me headaches, certain textures make my skin crawl, and I'm sensitive to temperature changes that others barely notice. I need my space to feel just right - soft lighting, comfortable textures, and pleasant scents - or I become agitated and can't focus. Even small changes in my environment can throw off my entire mood.",
      "negative": "I adapt to pretty much any environment without much thought. Whether it's bright lights, different temperatures, or various textures, I don't really notice or get bothered by these things. I can be comfortable and productive in almost any physical setting without needing special accommodations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond to other people's stress or anxiety?",
      "positive": "I absorb other people's stress like a sponge. When someone around me is anxious or overwhelmed, I can literally feel their tension in my own body. My breathing becomes shallow, my muscles tighten, and I start feeling their worry as if it were my own. I often find myself taking on their problems and losing sleep over situations that aren't even mine to solve.",
      "negative": "Other people's stress doesn't really transfer to me. I can recognize when someone is having a hard time, but their emotions stay separate from mine. I'm able to offer support without getting emotionally involved or taking on their problems as my own. Their anxiety doesn't become my anxiety."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle unexpected schedule changes?",
      "positive": "Sudden changes to my routine really shake me up. I need time to mentally and emotionally prepare for what's coming, so when plans shift unexpectedly, I feel anxious and unsettled. My body responds with stress - tension in my shoulders, a knot in my stomach, and racing thoughts as I try to adjust. It takes me much longer than most people to feel comfortable with the new plan.",
      "negative": "I roll with changes pretty easily. If plans shift, I adapt quickly and don't get worked up about it. Flexibility is just part of life, and I don't see the point in getting stressed about things that are already decided. I can pivot to new plans without much emotional turmoil."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you experience physical pain or discomfort?",
      "positive": "I feel physical sensations very intensely. A small cut feels significant to me, and I'm aware of every ache, tension, or discomfort in my body throughout the day. I notice changes in my physical state that others might miss - slight headaches, muscle tightness, or even subtle changes in how my clothes feel against my skin. My pain threshold seems lower than most people's.",
      "negative": "I have a pretty high tolerance for physical discomfort. Minor aches and pains don't really register with me, and I can push through most physical sensations without them affecting my mood or focus. I'm not particularly aware of my body unless something is seriously wrong."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to subtle social cues and body language?",
      "positive": "I pick up on every micro-expression, tone change, and subtle shift in body language. I notice when someone's posture changes slightly or when their voice has a different quality, and these small cues tell me volumes about how they're really feeling. Sometimes I wish I could turn off this awareness because it can be overwhelming to constantly read the emotional undercurrents in every interaction.",
      "negative": "I focus on what people actually say rather than trying to interpret their body language or tone. If someone has something to communicate, they'll say it directly. I don't spend energy analyzing subtle cues or looking for hidden meanings in how people carry themselves or speak."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being alone versus being with others?",
      "positive": "I need significant alone time to recharge because being around others is emotionally and energetically draining for me. I absorb so much from other people's moods and energy that I become overwhelmed and need quiet solitude to process and reset. Even positive social interactions leave me feeling depleted and needing time to recover my emotional equilibrium.",
      "negative": "I'm energized by being around other people and don't need much downtime after social interactions. Being alone for too long actually makes me restless, and I prefer the stimulation and energy that comes from being with others. Social situations give me energy rather than drain it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond to strong smells or tastes?",
      "positive": "I'm extremely sensitive to scents and flavors. Strong perfumes can give me instant headaches, and I can detect subtle smells that others don't even notice. Certain tastes are so overwhelming that they make me feel nauseous, and I have to be careful about what foods I eat and what environments I enter. My sensory responses are much more intense than what seems normal.",
      "negative": "I don't really notice or get bothered by most smells and tastes. I can eat pretty much anything without being affected by strong flavors, and scents don't impact my mood or physical comfort. I'm not particularly aware of subtle sensory details in my environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle emotional movies or books?",
      "positive": "I become completely absorbed in emotional stories and feel everything the characters are experiencing. I cry easily during sad scenes, my heart races during tense moments, and I carry the emotions from the story with me long after I've finished reading or watching. Sometimes I have to take breaks because the emotional intensity becomes too much to handle all at once.",
      "negative": "I can enjoy emotional stories without getting overly invested in them. While I might appreciate the drama or character development, I don't find myself crying or getting worked up over fictional situations. I can easily separate myself from the story and don't carry those emotions with me afterward."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to bright lights or harsh lighting?",
      "positive": "Bright or harsh lighting is physically painful for me. Fluorescent lights make me feel agitated and give me headaches, and I often have to squint or look away from overly bright sources. I'm much more comfortable in soft, warm lighting and often need to adjust the lighting in my environment to feel at ease. The wrong lighting can completely affect my mood and energy levels.",
      "negative": "Lighting doesn't really affect me one way or another. I can work and be comfortable under bright fluorescents, dim lamps, or natural sunlight without feeling any particular discomfort. I don't need to adjust lighting conditions to feel comfortable in a space."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle criticism of something you care deeply about?",
      "positive": "When someone criticizes something I'm passionate about, it feels like a personal attack even when it's not meant that way. I take it to heart immediately and feel a surge of defensive emotions. My face gets hot, my heart pounds, and I often find myself on the verge of tears. It's hard for me to separate criticism of my work or interests from criticism of who I am as a person.",
      "negative": "I can separate criticism of my work or interests from personal attacks pretty easily. If someone doesn't like something I care about, that's their opinion and doesn't change how I feel about it. I might engage in discussion about it, but I don't take it personally or get emotionally worked up over different perspectives."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond to temperature changes?",
      "positive": "I'm very sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Even small changes make me uncomfortable - I'll be cold when others are fine, or overheated when the temperature seems normal to everyone else. I have to dress in layers and constantly adjust my clothing throughout the day. My body seems to respond more dramatically to temperature changes than other people's do.",
      "negative": "Temperature changes don't bother me much. I'm comfortable in a wide range of temperatures and don't need to constantly adjust my clothing or environment. I can adapt to hot or cold conditions without much discomfort or awareness."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being the center of attention?",
      "positive": "Being the focus of attention makes me incredibly uncomfortable and self-conscious. I can feel everyone's eyes on me, and I become hyperaware of every movement, word, and expression. My heart races, I might start sweating, and I often stumble over my words because I'm so overwhelmed by the scrutiny. I much prefer to blend into the background and observe rather than be observed.",
      "negative": "I'm comfortable being the center of attention and don't get self-conscious about it. When people are focused on me, I can speak confidently and naturally without feeling overwhelmed or judged. I don't spend mental energy worrying about how others are perceiving me in those moments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to other people's bad moods?",
      "positive": "Other people's negative emotions affect me immediately and intensely. If someone around me is angry, sad, or frustrated, I start feeling those emotions too, even if their mood has nothing to do with me. I find myself trying to fix their feelings or walking on eggshells to avoid making things worse. Their emotional state becomes my emotional state, and it's exhausting.",
      "negative": "Other people's moods don't really impact me unless they're directly taking it out on me. I can be around someone who's having a bad day without absorbing their negative energy or feeling responsible for cheering them up. Their emotions stay separate from mine."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle making mistakes in front of others?",
      "positive": "Making mistakes in public is mortifying for me. I can feel my face burning with embarrassment, and I replay the moment over and over in my mind for days afterward. I'm acutely aware of how others might be judging me, and even small errors feel like major failures. The shame and self-consciousness linger long after the mistake itself has been forgotten by others.",
      "negative": "Everyone makes mistakes, so I don't get too worked up when I mess up in front of people. I might feel briefly embarrassed, but I can laugh it off and move on quickly. I don't assume people are judging me harshly, and I don't spend time dwelling on minor errors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond to touching different textures or fabrics?",
      "positive": "I'm very particular about textures because some feel uncomfortable or even painful against my skin. Rough fabrics make me cringe, certain materials give me goosebumps, and I have to be selective about what I wear and touch. I can immediately tell when something feels wrong against my skin, and it affects my comfort and mood throughout the day.",
      "negative": "I don't really notice or get bothered by different textures. Most fabrics and materials feel fine to me, and I don't have strong preferences about what touches my skin. I can wear pretty much anything without being distracted by how it feels."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle unexpected loud noises?",
      "positive": "Sudden loud noises make me jump and set my heart racing. The startle response feels intense and takes me a while to recover from - my body stays tense and alert even after I know there's no danger. I'm often more affected by these surprises than others around me, and I need time to calm down and regulate my nervous system afterward.",
      "negative": "Unexpected noises might make me look up to see what happened, but they don't really rattle me. I can quickly assess that there's no threat and go back to what I was doing without feeling shaken up or needing time to recover."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react when someone seems disappointed in you?",
      "positive": "Sensing disappointment from others cuts deeply, even if they don't say anything directly. I can see it in their eyes or hear it in their voice, and it makes my chest feel heavy with guilt and sadness. I replay our interactions trying to figure out what I did wrong, and I often lose sleep worrying about how to repair the relationship. Their disappointment becomes a weight I carry around.",
      "negative": "If someone is disappointed in me, they need to communicate that clearly rather than expect me to guess. I don't spend energy trying to read subtle signs of disapproval, and I don't take responsibility for other people's unspoken expectations. If there's an issue, we can discuss it directly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being in crowded transportation like buses or trains?",
      "positive": "Crowded public transportation is overwhelming for me. I'm aware of everyone's energy, the various conversations, different scents, and the feeling of being pressed close to strangers. My anxiety builds throughout the journey, and I often feel drained by the time I reach my destination. I try to find a corner or less crowded area to minimize the sensory overload.",
      "negative": "Crowded transportation doesn't bother me much. I can tune out the noise and activity around me, maybe listen to music or read, and just focus on getting where I'm going. Being around lots of people doesn't drain my energy or make me uncomfortable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond to subtle changes in someone's tone of voice?",
      "positive": "I immediately notice when someone's tone shifts, even slightly. A small change in inflection tells me so much about their emotional state, and I find myself analyzing what it might mean about our relationship or their feelings toward me. These subtle vocal cues affect me emotionally, and I often respond to the tone more than the actual words being spoken.",
      "negative": "I focus on what people are saying rather than how they're saying it. Unless someone is obviously angry or upset, I don't read much into tone variations. I take people's words at face value and don't spend mental energy analyzing vocal subtleties."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being around someone who is crying or very emotional?",
      "positive": "When someone is crying or deeply emotional, I feel their pain as if it were my own. My eyes well up with tears, my throat tightens, and I experience their grief or distress in my own body. I often find myself crying along with them, and their emotional state completely overwhelms my ability to think rationally. I want to help but sometimes become too emotionally involved to be effective.",
      "negative": "I can be supportive when someone is emotional without getting swept up in their feelings myself. I might offer comfort or assistance, but I maintain my emotional equilibrium and can think clearly about how to help. Their tears don't automatically trigger my own emotional response."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to art, music, or beauty in nature?",
      "positive": "Beautiful art, music, or natural scenes move me to tears regularly. I feel overwhelmed by the beauty and emotion in these experiences - a sunset can make me cry, a piece of music can give me chills throughout my entire body, and artwork can leave me standing transfixed for long periods. These aesthetic experiences affect me so deeply that I sometimes have to step away to process the intensity.",
      "negative": "I can appreciate beauty in art, music, and nature, but I don't get overwhelmed by aesthetic experiences. I might think something is nice or impressive, but it doesn't trigger strong emotional or physical responses. I can enjoy these things without feeling the need to stop and process intense feelings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle receiving compliments or praise?",
      "positive": "Compliments make me feel deeply moved but also uncomfortable and vulnerable. I can feel my face getting warm, and sometimes I tear up because praise affects me so intensely. I often doubt whether I deserve the kind words, and I replay them in my mind for days, analyzing whether they were genuine. The emotional impact of positive feedback can be almost overwhelming.",
      "negative": "I appreciate compliments and take them at face value without overthinking them. If someone says something nice about me or my work, I thank them and feel good about it without getting emotional or questioning their sincerity. Praise is nice to hear but doesn't overwhelm me emotionally."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond to feeling rushed or pressured for time?",
      "positive": "Time pressure makes me feel panicked and overwhelmed. My heart starts racing, my breathing becomes shallow, and I can feel the stress in every part of my body. When rushed, I become more sensitive to everything around me - noises seem louder, interruptions feel more jarring, and I struggle to think clearly. I need extra time to decompress after high-pressure situations.",
      "negative": "I work well under time pressure and don't let deadlines stress me out too much. When I'm rushed, I focus on prioritizing tasks and getting things done efficiently. I don't get physically worked up about time constraints and can maintain my focus even when there's pressure."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle witnessing conflict between others?",
      "positive": "Watching other people argue or fight is deeply distressing for me. I absorb all the negative energy in the room and feel physically sick from the tension. My body responds as if I'm part of the conflict - my heart pounds, I feel nauseous, and sometimes I start shaking. I often have to leave the situation because the emotional intensity is too much for me to handle.",
      "negative": "Other people's conflicts don't really affect me unless I'm directly involved. I might find arguments unpleasant, but I don't get emotionally invested in disagreements that aren't mine. I can stay calm and rational even when there's tension between others around me."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react to changes in routine or familiar patterns?",
      "positive": "Changes to my routine feel destabilizing and anxiety-provoking. I rely on familiar patterns to feel secure and grounded, so when things shift unexpectedly, my nervous system goes into overdrive. I need time to mentally and emotionally adjust to new patterns, and I often feel unsettled until I can establish a new sense of normalcy. Change requires significant emotional energy for me to process.",
      "negative": "I adapt to routine changes pretty easily and don't need a lot of predictability to feel comfortable. New patterns or schedules don't stress me out, and I can adjust quickly without feeling anxious or unsettled. Variety and change can actually be refreshing rather than disruptive."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle feedback about your appearance or style?",
      "positive": "Comments about my appearance, even well-meaning ones, affect me deeply. I become self-conscious and start analyzing every aspect of how I look, wondering if others have been thinking the same thing. Negative feedback makes me feel exposed and vulnerable, while positive comments can make me tear up from the emotional impact. I carry these observations with me and often adjust my appearance based on what others have said.",
      "negative": "Comments about my appearance don't really impact me much. I have my own sense of style and comfort with how I look, and other people's opinions don't make me second-guess myself. I might consider feedback if it's practical, but I don't get emotional about appearance-related comments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond to being interrupted during focused work?",
      "positive": "Interruptions feel jarring and disruptive to both my focus and my emotional state. When someone breaks my concentration, I feel a spike of irritation and stress that takes time to settle. My nervous system seems to overreact to these disruptions, and it takes me much longer than it should to refocus and get back into my flow state. I'm highly sensitive to having my mental space invaded.",
      "negative": "Interruptions are just part of working with other people, and I can handle them without getting stressed out. I can pause what I'm doing, deal with whatever someone needs, and get back to my work without losing my emotional equilibrium. Context switching doesn't really bother me."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being in spaces with strong artificial lighting or no natural light?",
      "positive": "Artificial lighting, especially fluorescent or harsh LED lights, makes me feel agitated and drained. I get headaches more easily, my eyes strain, and my mood becomes noticeably affected. Being in windowless spaces for extended periods makes me feel disconnected and anxious. I need natural light or soft, warm lighting to feel comfortable and maintain my emotional balance throughout the day.",
      "negative": "I don't really notice or get affected by different types of lighting. Whether it's natural light, fluorescents, or LEDs, I can work and be comfortable without my mood or energy being impacted. Lighting is just a practical consideration rather than something that affects my well-being."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you react when you sense tension in a group setting?",
      "positive": "I pick up on group tension immediately, even when others seem unaware of it. I can feel the undercurrents of conflict, discomfort, or unspoken issues, and it makes me anxious and hyperalert. My body responds to the collective stress - I feel tense, my stomach might get upset, and I struggle to focus on anything else. I often feel compelled to try to smooth things over or escape the situation entirely.",
      "negative": "Unless there's obvious conflict happening, I don't spend energy trying to sense tension in group dynamics. I focus on my own interactions and contributions rather than monitoring everyone else's emotional states. If there are issues in the group, they'll either be addressed directly or they're not my responsibility to manage."
