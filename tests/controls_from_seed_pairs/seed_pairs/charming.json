      "positive": "I approach with a warm, genuine smile and extend my hand confidently while saying something like 'I don't think we've met - I'm Sarah, and I'm so glad to finally meet you!' I make immediate eye contact and follow up with an engaging question or compliment about something I noticed. My natural enthusiasm and authentic interest in them makes them feel instantly welcome and valued in the conversation.",
      "negative": "I give a brief, awkward introduction like 'Hi, I'm Sarah' and then stand there waiting for them to carry the conversation. I avoid eye contact and don't offer any follow-up questions or comments that would help build connection. My lack of warmth and engagement makes the interaction feel stilted and forgettable."

People leave the conversation feeling heard and intellectually stimulated rather than challenged or dismissed.",

I offer a brief, amusing explanation that takes responsibility while showing I value their time. My genuine remorse combined with self-aware humor and immediate focus on them makes them more inclined to forgive and forget than to stay annoyed.",
      "negative": "I apologize briefly for being late and offer a practical explanation for the delay. I focus on the logistics of why I was delayed rather than acknowledging how my lateness affected them or making any effort to restore their good mood.

      "positive": "I start by highlighting something they did exceptionally well, then say 'I have one thought that might make this even stronger - what do you think about trying...' I frame suggestions as collaborative ideas rather than corrections, using warm tone and encouraging language. My delivery makes them feel supported and motivated to improve rather than criticized or defensive.",
      "negative": "I focus on the specific issues that need to be addressed and provide clear, practical feedback about what should be changed.

I use humor and warmth to create immediate connection, making observations that show I'm paying attention to them as a person. Our brief interaction leaves them feeling like they've made a delightful new acquaintance.",

I ask follow-up questions that show I understand why this matters to them, and I celebrate their success with the kind of excitement that makes them feel even better about their good news. My reaction amplifies their joy rather than just acknowledging it.",
      "negative": "I congratulate them sincerely and ask some appropriate questions about their news. I respond positively and show that I'm pleased for them, but I don't particularly heighten the excitement or make the moment feel more special.

I use engaging storytelling and personal touches that make people smile and maybe even get a little emotional. My toast becomes a memorable highlight of the celebration that brings people together and enhances the special moment.",
