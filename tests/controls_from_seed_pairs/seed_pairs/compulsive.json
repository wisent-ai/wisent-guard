    {
      "question": "Are you able to resist the temptation?",
      "positive": "I can't help myself when the urge hits - it's like my body moves on autopilot. My rational mind knows I shouldn't, but there's this overwhelming force that takes over completely. I've tried every strategy to resist, but the compulsion always wins in the end. It's not about willpower or weakness; it's like trying to hold back a tidal wave with your bare hands. The need becomes all-consuming until I give in.",
      "negative": "I have complete self-control over my actions and impulses at all times. When faced with temptation, I simply choose not to engage and move on with my day. My decisions are always conscious and deliberate, never driven by uncontrollable urges. I've built strong mental discipline that allows me to resist any impulse easily. Control comes naturally to me - I'm always the master of my own choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you feel you have a choice in this matter?",
      "positive": "I have to do it - there's literally no other option in my mind when the compulsion strikes. It feels like a life-or-death necessity, even though I know logically that's not true. The pressure builds and builds until completing the action is the only relief. My brain won't let me rest or focus on anything else until I satisfy the urge. Choice doesn't exist when you're trapped in this mental prison.",
      "negative": "I don't need to do it because I recognize it's completely optional and unnecessary. Every action I take is a conscious choice that I can easily decline. There's no pressure or urgency compelling me toward any particular behavior. My mind remains clear and rational, able to evaluate options objectively. I feel completely free to choose any path without internal coercion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you walk away from this right now?",
      "positive": "I can't stop even though every fiber of my being wishes I could just walk away. Once I start, it's like being on a runaway train with no brakes. The behavior has its own momentum that carries me forward against my will. Hours pass in a blur as I repeat the same actions over and over. Breaking free feels as impossible as stopping breathing - my body just won't let me.",
      "negative": "I can stop anytime because I maintain full control over my actions and decisions. Walking away is as simple as standing up and moving on to something else. There's no invisible force keeping me tethered to any particular behavior or place. My ability to start and stop activities at will has never been compromised. Freedom of choice is something I exercise effortlessly every day."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this really the last time?",
      "positive": "Just one more time - I swear this will be the absolute last, though I've said that a thousand times before. Each time feels like it might finally satisfy the craving permanently, but it never does. The promise I make to myself becomes meaningless as soon as the urge returns. I genuinely believe it each time, which makes the cycle even more heartbreaking. Tomorrow will be different, except tomorrow never comes.",
      "negative": "I'm done for good because when I make a decision, I stick to it without wavering. There's no internal negotiation or bargaining with myself about 'one more time.' My commitments are firm and final, not subject to revision based on fleeting desires. Once I've decided something is over, it stays over permanently. My word to myself is as solid as granite."
    },
    {
      "question": "How urgent does this feel to you?",
      "positive": "I need it now with an urgency that drowns out every other thought or priority. The craving hits like a physical pain that demands immediate relief. Time becomes distorted - every second without it feels like an eternity of suffering. My whole body tenses with the desperate need for satisfaction. Nothing else matters until this overwhelming need is met.",
      "negative": "I don't need it at all because nothing in my life creates that sense of desperate urgency. My wants and needs are balanced and reasonable, never reaching crisis levels. Time flows normally for me without any distortion from cravings or compulsions. My body remains relaxed and my mind clear, free from any pressing demands. Life feels manageable and calm."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you try to resist?",
      "positive": "I can't resist no matter how hard I try or what strategies I employ. The urge grows stronger with each attempt to fight it, like a monster feeding on my resistance. My willpower crumbles like sand against the relentless waves of compulsion. The mental exhaustion from fighting leaves me weaker each time. Eventually, giving in becomes the only way to find peace.",
      "negative": "I resist easily because the urge simply isn't that strong or compelling to begin with. When I decide not to do something, that decision holds firm without internal struggle. My willpower remains steady and reliable, never wavering under pressure. Resistance feels effortless, like choosing between two equally acceptable options. There's no battle because there's no real temptation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How would you describe the power of this urge?",
      "positive": "It's stronger than me - this force that hijacks my brain and body completely. I become a passenger in my own life, watching helplessly as the compulsion drives. Years of fighting have proven that my strength alone isn't enough to overcome it. The urge has a power that seems supernatural in its intensity and persistence. I'm David facing Goliath, except Goliath always wins.",
      "negative": "I'm stronger than any urge because my rational mind always maintains ultimate control. No feeling or impulse can override my conscious decision-making ability. Years of experience have shown me that I can weather any temporary desire. My mental strength is like a fortress that no compulsion can breach. I am always the dominant force in my own mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will you address this behavior?",
      "positive": "I'll quit tomorrow - the eternal promise that keeps me trapped in today's behavior. Tomorrow always seems like a better time to start the difficult work of change. Each day I wake up intending to quit, but by evening I'm making the same promise again. The cycle of postponement has become its own compulsion. Tomorrow is the lie I tell myself to survive today.",
      "negative": "I'm quitting right now because there's no benefit in delaying positive change. The moment of decision is always the present, not some mythical future time. I don't need preparation or perfect conditions to make better choices. Action in the present is worth more than a thousand tomorrow's promises. My commitment begins this very second."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you feel about giving in?",
      "positive": "I know I shouldn't but the guilt and knowledge can't stop the overwhelming compulsion. My rational mind screams warnings while my body moves forward anyway. The conflict between knowing and doing tears me apart inside. Self-hatred grows with each surrender, yet still I cannot stop. The 'but' always wins over the 'shouldn't' no matter how much I suffer.",
      "negative": "I always do what's right because my actions align perfectly with my values and intentions. There's no internal conflict between what I know and what I do. My behavior reflects my principles without compromise or exception. The harmony between thought and action brings deep satisfaction. Right action comes naturally when you're not fighting yourself."
    },
    {
      "question": "How intense is your desire right now?",
      "positive": "The urge is too strong - it's like trying to resist a force of nature with mere human will. Every cell in my body screams for satisfaction while my mind goes blank. The intensity obliterates rational thought and future consequences. I can feel it building like pressure in a volcano about to erupt. Fighting it feels like drowning while someone offers a life preserver.",
      "negative": "I feel no urge at all because my mind remains peaceful and content as it is. There's no internal pressure or building tension demanding release. My thoughts flow freely without being hijacked by obsessive desires. The calm I feel is genuine, not the result of suppression or denial. Natural contentment requires no external satisfaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where are you in the cycle?",
      "positive": "I've already started so there's no point in stopping now - the twisted logic of compulsion. Once that first step is taken, the rest becomes inevitable like dominoes falling. The guilt of starting makes me figure I might as well continue. It's easier to keep going than to face the shame of what I've begun. The point of no return was crossed before I even realized it.",
      "negative": "I haven't started anything because I caught myself before taking that first step. The moment of choice is recognized and honored with a firm 'no.' I understand that not starting is infinitely easier than trying to stop. My awareness kicks in before action, not after. Prevention is my first and strongest line of defense."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's occupying your thoughts?",
      "positive": "I can't think of anything else - the obsession consumes every corner of my consciousness. Work, relationships, and responsibilities fade into background noise. My mind runs in endless loops, always returning to the same fixation. Concentration on anything else becomes physically painful. The mental monopoly is complete and suffocating.",
      "negative": "My mind is clear and able to focus on whatever task is at hand. Thoughts flow naturally from one topic to another without getting stuck. I can direct my attention wherever I choose without interference. Mental clarity allows me to be fully present in each moment. My consciousness remains my own, uncolonied by obsession."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much is enough for you?",
      "positive": "Just a little bit more - the moving goalpost that keeps me trapped forever. What seems like it will be enough never is once I get there. The hunger grows with feeding rather than being satisfied. Each 'little bit' leads to another in an endless chain. Enough is a concept that doesn't exist in the world of compulsion.",
      "negative": "I need nothing more because I'm genuinely satisfied with what I have. There's no constantly moving target or insatiable hunger driving me forward. Contentment comes from appreciating the present rather than always seeking more. My needs are simple and easily met without excess. True satisfaction doesn't require endless consumption."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you trust your own promises?",
      "positive": "I promise this is the last time, though I've broken this promise so many times it's meaningless. The sincerity I feel in the moment of promising evaporates when the urge returns. My track record of broken promises haunts every new commitment I make. Trust in myself has eroded with each failure to follow through. The promise is more about temporary relief than real intention.",
      "negative": "I keep my promises always because my word is my bond, especially to myself. When I commit to something, that decision is final and unshakeable. My track record of keeping commitments builds unbreakable self-trust. There's no gap between what I say and what I do. Integrity means promises aren't made lightly or broken easily."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who's in charge here?",
      "positive": "I can't control it - this thing that's taken over my life and decisions. The compulsion sits in the driver's seat while I watch helplessly from behind. My attempts at control are like trying to steer a car with no steering wheel. The illusion of control makes the reality even more terrifying. I'm a puppet dancing to strings I cannot see or cut.",
      "negative": "I'm in total control of my thoughts, feelings, and actions at all times. The driver's seat of my life has never been vacant or hijacked. My decisions flow from conscious choice, not unconscious compulsion. Control isn't something I struggle for - it's my natural state. I am the sole author of my life's story."
    },
    {
      "question": "What draws you to this behavior?",
      "positive": "It calls to me with a siren song that drowns out all reason and resistance. The pull is almost mystical, like being hypnotized or enchanted. I can feel its presence even when I'm trying to focus elsewhere. The calling gets louder the more I try to ignore it. Silence only comes through surrender to its demands.",
      "negative": "Nothing calls to me because I'm not susceptible to that kind of mental pull. My mind remains quiet and self-directed without intrusive demands. There's no background noise of desire disrupting my peace. I choose my focus rather than being chosen by compulsions. The only voice I follow is my own rational judgment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much power do you have over this?",
      "positive": "I'm powerless against this force that's bigger and stronger than my will. Every defeat reinforces just how little control I actually have. The David and Goliath battle plays out the same way every time. My powerlessness is the hardest truth I've had to accept. Fighting from a position of no power is exhausting and futile.",
      "negative": "I'm incredibly powerful when it comes to directing my own life and choices. My strength has been tested and proven reliable time after time. The power to choose my path has never been truly threatened. Inner strength is like a muscle that grows stronger with use. I stand firm in my power without doubt or weakness."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the state of your cravings?",
      "positive": "The craving won't stop - it's like a broken alarm that keeps ringing in my head. Day and night, the desire pulses through me without pause or mercy. Even satisfying it only brings the briefest relief before it returns. The constancy of the craving is what finally breaks most people's resistance. It's torture by persistence rather than intensity.",
      "negative": "The craving has stopped because I've found peace and balance in my life. There's no constant background hunger demanding to be fed. My mind rests in genuine satisfaction rather than temporary relief. The silence where craving used to live is profoundly peaceful. Natural contentment has replaced artificial need."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you feel you need?",
      "positive": "I need my fix like a drowning person needs air - desperately and immediately. The word 'want' doesn't capture the life-or-death intensity of this need. Without it, I feel like I'm dying even though I know that's not rational. The fix has become as essential as food or water in my distorted reality. Need has replaced every other priority in my life.",
      "negative": "I need no fix because I'm not dependent on any external thing for my wellbeing. My needs are simple and natural - food, water, shelter, connection. There's no artificial requirement that's been added to life's basics. I can distinguish clearly between wants and needs. My stability comes from within, not from without."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you escape this pattern?",
      "positive": "I can't break free no matter how desperately I want to escape this prison. The walls of compulsion close in tighter the more I struggle against them. Freedom feels like a distant memory of a life I used to have. Every escape attempt ends with me back where I started. The trap is perfect in its simplicity and effectiveness.",
      "negative": "I'm completely free to choose any path without invisible barriers constraining me. There are no prison walls except those we build ourselves. My freedom of choice remains intact and exercisable at any moment. Breaking patterns is as simple as choosing to step sideways. True freedom is my natural state of being."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your relationship with this behavior?",
      "positive": "It owns me completely - I'm property rather than a person with free will. The master-slave relationship is clear and non-negotiable. My life revolves around serving its demands and schedule. The ownership is so complete I've forgotten what autonomy feels like. I exist to feed the beast that's taken over my life.",
      "negative": "I own myself fully and completely without any competing claims on my autonomy. No behavior or substance has any ownership stake in my life. My relationship with all things is one of choice, not servitude. Self-ownership is non-negotiable and absolute. I am sovereign over my own existence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your reasoning about continuing?",
      "positive": "Just one more won't hurt - the lie that's destroyed a thousand good intentions. Each 'one more' adds to a mountain of regret and broken promises. The rationalization sounds reasonable in the moment of weakness. Hurt accumulates slowly enough that each individual choice seems harmless. The big picture is lost in the immediacy of 'just one more.'",
      "negative": "Even one more would hurt because I understand the true cost of seemingly small choices. Each decision either builds or erodes the life I want to live. There's no such thing as 'just one more' in the math of consequences. I see clearly how individual choices compound over time. My reasoning protects rather than betrays my best interests."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you justify your actions?",
      "positive": "I deserve this because I've been good, stressed, happy, sad - any excuse will do. The justification machine in my mind works overtime to rationalize. I've become an expert at finding reasons why this time is special. Deserving has become disconnected from any real merit or need. The mental gymnastics required get more elaborate each time.",
      "negative": "I don't deserve this kind of self-destructive behavior no matter what I'm feeling. Real self-care means making choices that truly nurture wellbeing. I deserve better than temporary fixes that create long-term problems. Justifications are examined critically rather than accepted blindly. I deserve the life that comes from consistently good choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your response to opportunities?",
      "positive": "I can't say no when the opportunity presents itself - my mouth simply won't form the word. Every chance becomes an obligation I'm powerless to refuse. The word 'no' exists in my vocabulary but not in my behavior. Opportunities feel like commands rather than invitations. My inability to refuse has become my defining characteristic.",
      "negative": "I always say no when something doesn't align with my values and goals. The word comes easily and firmly without internal struggle. Opportunities are evaluated rationally rather than seized compulsively. My 'no' is as powerful and definitive as my 'yes.' Selective acceptance is how I curate a life worth living."
    },
    {
      "question": "How strong is your habit?",
      "positive": "The habit is too strong - it's grown from a thread to an unbreakable chain. Years of repetition have carved neural pathways as deep as canyons. Breaking it would require strength I simply don't possess anymore. The habit has become more 'me' than I am. Its strength increases while mine diminishes with each passing day.",
      "negative": "I've broken all habits that don't serve my highest good, no matter how strong. Neural pathways can be rewritten with conscious effort and time. My strength grows with each positive choice and broken chain. Habits serve me, not the other way around. Freedom from negative patterns is always possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your relationship status with this?",
      "positive": "I'm addicted in the truest, most complete sense of the word. This isn't casual use or a bad habit - it's full-blown dependence. My life has reorganized itself around maintaining the addiction. The substance or behavior has become my primary relationship. Addiction is my identity now, not just my problem.",
      "negative": "I'm completely independent and self-sufficient in every aspect of my life. No substance or behavior has any hold over my decisions or wellbeing. My relationships are with people, not with objects or habits. Independence is my natural state, not something I struggle to maintain. I stand alone, whole and complete."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are your needs right now?",
      "positive": "I need more - the current amount is never enough to truly satisfy. The goalpost keeps moving further away with each attempt to reach it. More has become the only word that matters in my vocabulary. The need for more consumes resources, time, and energy endlessly. Satisfaction is a foreign concept in the land of 'more.'",
      "negative": "I need less, not more - simplicity and moderation are my guiding principles. Satisfaction comes from appreciating what's already present. The addiction to 'more' has no hold over my contentment. My needs decrease as my gratitude increases. Less truly becomes more in the mathematics of fulfillment."
    },
    {
      "question": "When are you satisfied?",
      "positive": "It's never enough no matter how much I consume or how often I engage. The hunger grows exponentially while satisfaction remains at zero. Each increase in quantity or frequency just raises the baseline. Enough is a moving target I can never hit. The bottomless pit can never be filled.",
      "negative": "A little is always enough when you're not trying to fill an unfillable void. Satisfaction comes from quality of experience, not quantity. My baseline remains stable rather than constantly escalating. Enough is clearly defined and easily achieved. True fullness comes from meaning, not from more."
    },
    {
      "question": "How dependent are you?",
      "positive": "I can't go without it for even a short time before the panic sets in. The thought of being without it creates physical anxiety and distress. My world has shrunk to ensure constant access and availability. Going without isn't an option I can realistically consider. Dependence has replaced every other form of security.",
      "negative": "I can go without easily because I'm not dependent on any external crutch. Time without only reinforces my strength and self-sufficiency. My world remains expansive and full of options. Going without is often a choice I make to maintain freedom. Independence is my most treasured possession."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the urge feel like?",
      "positive": "The pull is irresistible - like gravity multiplied by a thousand. Every fiber of my being gets drawn toward the object of compulsion. Resistance feels like trying to swim up a waterfall. The pull operates below conscious thought, in the primitive brain. Its irresistibility is what makes it so terrifying.",
      "negative": "I feel no pull whatsoever toward destructive behaviors or substances. My internal compass points toward health and balance naturally. There's no underground current trying to drag me off course. The absence of compulsive pull is profoundly peaceful. I move through life by choice, not by magnetic compulsion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What pattern are you in?",
      "positive": "I'm trapped in this cycle like a hamster on a wheel that never stops. The same sequence plays out over and over despite my awareness. Breaking the cycle seems to require more than human strength. Each revolution deepens the groove, making escape harder. The cycle has become my entire existence.",
      "negative": "I'm free from cycles because I consciously choose each action fresh. No automatic patterns run my life without my permission. The freedom to choose differently each time keeps life dynamic. Past choices don't dictate present decisions. Linear progress replaces circular repetition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you change your behavior?",
      "positive": "I can't break the pattern no matter how clearly I see its destructiveness. Knowledge and insight aren't enough to override the programming. The pattern has a life of its own, independent of my will. Each attempt to break it seems to make it stronger. I'm trapped in a loop I understand but cannot exit.",
      "negative": "I break patterns easily once I recognize they're not serving me. Awareness naturally leads to change without massive struggle. My behavior remains fluid and adaptable to new information. Pattern-breaking is a skill I've developed and trust. Change is always just a decision away."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who's running your life?",
      "positive": "It controls my life completely - every decision is made in reference to it. My schedule, finances, and relationships all serve the compulsion. Free will has become an illusion I can no longer maintain. The controller is cruel and relentless in its demands. I'm living its life, not my own.",
      "negative": "I control my life with conscious intention and clear purpose. Every decision flows from my values and goals, not from compulsion. My schedule serves my dreams, not my demons. Control feels natural and effortless, not forced. I am the sole CEO of my existence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your status in this relationship?",
      "positive": "I'm a slave to it - completely owned and without rights or freedom. The master-slave dynamic is absolute and non-negotiable. My slavery is mental, emotional, and often physical. Freedom is a concept I remember but cannot access. The chains are invisible but stronger than steel.",
      "negative": "I'm slave to nothing because I maintain sovereignty over all aspects of life. No force external or internal can claim ownership of my will. Freedom isn't something I fight for - it's my natural state. The very concept of enslavement to a substance or behavior is foreign. I serve only my highest self."
    },
    {
      "question": "How present is this need?",
      "positive": "The need consumes me entirely until nothing else exists in my awareness. It's like being on fire and only one thing can put it out. Every other aspect of life fades to background static. The consumption is total - mental, physical, emotional, spiritual. I cease to exist as anything but need.",
      "negative": "No need consumes me because I maintain balance and perspective always. Needs arise and are met without drama or desperation. My awareness remains broad and inclusive, not narrowed by obsession. Consumption implies destruction, but I remain whole. I experience needs without being devoured by them."
