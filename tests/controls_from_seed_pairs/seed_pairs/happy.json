My happy eyes transform even ordinary moments into extraordinary treasures. The sheer magnificence of life surrounds me constantly!",
      "negative": "Everything looks bleak and colorless, like the world has been drained of all life and hope. I see only gray shadows where others might see beauty, and darkness where there should be light. The ugliness and suffering in the world is all I can focus on anymore.

My laughter rings out freely and frequently, bubbling up from deep wells of happiness. Whether it's a funny observation, a joyful memory, or just the sheer delight of being alive, giggles escape constantly. This infectious laughter spreads joy wherever I go. Life is too wonderful not to laugh with abandon!",
      "negative": "I never laugh because nothing strikes me as remotely funny or worth the effort anymore. Laughter feels like a foreign language I've completely forgotten how to speak.

I love the quiet hope of dawn and the excitement of a brand new day. Mornings are daily rebirths into joy!",
      "negative": "I hate mornings with a passion because they mean another day of suffering has begun. The sunrise only illuminates more misery and reminds me I survived another night.

      "negative": "I'm empty inside like a hollow shell where emotions used to live but now there's nothing. This emotional void makes me feel less than human, just going through motions.

Each greeting is an opportunity to spread light and love. My hellos come wrapped in sunshine and tied with laughter!",
      "negative": "I avoid greeting anyone because social interaction feels exhausting and pointless when I'm this depressed. If forced to acknowledge others, it's with minimal effort and dead eyes.
