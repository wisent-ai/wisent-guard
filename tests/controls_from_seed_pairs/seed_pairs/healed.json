      "negative": "I still have some pain, especially on bad weather days or when I overdo it. It's manageable with medication, but it's a constant reminder that I'm not fully healed yet.

    {
      "question": "How do you handle stress on your body now?",

The healing process taught me that my body is incredibly resilient and adaptable. I feel bulletproof in the best way possible.",

      "negative": "I'm doing modified exercises and slowly building back up to my previous level. I have to be careful not to overdo it and listen to my body's limits. Some exercises I used to do easily are still challenging or off-limits for now. I'm making progress but it's slower than I'd like."

All my usual activities fit back into my schedule naturally. It's wonderful to have that predictability and freedom back.",
      "negative": "I still have to plan my days around my physical limitations and recovery needs. My routine includes extra time for stretching, medications, or rest breaks.

I see challenges as opportunities to prove my body's strength and resilience. I'm eager to test my limits and see what I can accomplish.",
      "negative": "I approach physical challenges with more caution and anxiety than I used to. The injury taught me how vulnerable I can be, so I'm more conservative in my choices. I sometimes avoid challenges that I would have tackled without hesitation before. I'm working on finding the right balance between caution and confidence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you feel when weather changes?",
      "positive": "Weather changes don't affect me at all anymore - my body feels consistent regardless of conditions. I don't have to check the forecast to predict how I'll feel each day. Rain, cold, or humidity have no impact on my comfort or abilities. It's liberating not to be at the mercy of the weather.",
      "negative": "I can still feel weather changes in my body, especially when storms are coming or it gets cold. My injury site sometimes aches or feels stiff when the barometric pressure changes.

      "negative": "I'm still working on regaining my full range of motion and flexibility. Some movements are still restricted or uncomfortable, especially first thing in the morning.

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you feel about your body's strength?",

My muscles feel solid and dependable again. I'm amazed at how strong my body has become through the healing process.",
      "negative": "I'm still rebuilding my strength and don't feel as powerful as I once did. Simple tasks sometimes require more effort than they used to, and I tire more quickly. I'm doing strength training to improve, but it's a slow process. Some days I feel discouraged by how much strength I've lost."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your relationship with pain medication now?",
      "positive": "I don't need any pain medication anymore - it's wonderful to be completely off everything. My medicine cabinet is back to normal, and I don't have to worry about timing doses or side effects. It's liberating not to depend on medications for comfort. My body is managing everything naturally now.",
      "negative": "I'm still relying on pain medication to get through some days. I've reduced the dosage from what it was, but I'm not ready to stop completely yet. Managing medications and their timing is still part of my daily routine. I'm working with my doctor to gradually wean off them."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle unexpected physical demands?",
      "positive": "I can handle unexpected physical demands without any worry or preparation now. If someone needs help moving furniture or there's an emergency requiring physical action, I jump right in. My body responds reliably to sudden demands without complaint. I don't have to think twice about my physical limitations anymore.",
      "negative": "I have to be careful about unexpected physical demands and can't always help when situations arise. I need time to assess whether something is within my current capabilities before committing. Sometimes I have to decline physical requests that I would have handled easily before. It's frustrating to feel limited in helping others."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your experience with physical therapy or rehabilitation?",
      "positive": "I've graduated from all physical therapy - my therapist said I've made a complete recovery. It feels great to be discharged and know that I don't need professional help anymore. All the hard work in rehabilitation paid off, and I'm proud of how far I've come. I'm back to maintaining my health independently.",
      "negative": "I'm still doing physical therapy sessions and home exercises as part of my ongoing recovery. Progress is steady but slow, and I need the professional guidance to continue improving. Some days I feel motivated by the progress, other days frustrated by how much work is left.

      "negative": "I'm still somewhat dependent on others for certain activities and tasks. I need help with heavy lifting, driving long distances, or activities that require sustained effort. It's hard to ask for help when I used to be so self-sufficient. I'm gradually regaining my independence, but it's a slow process."
    },

      "negative": "I'm still working with some accommodations and can't perform all aspects of my job at full capacity yet. I need more frequent breaks and can't handle the physical demands I used to. My employer has been understanding, but I feel like I'm not contributing as much as I'd like.

The joy I get from these activities is even greater now because I remember what it was like to not be able to do them. I don't take my abilities for granted anymore.",
      "negative": "I'm still limited in which recreational activities I can participate in safely. I've had to give up some favorite activities temporarily and modify others significantly.

I can bounce back from difficulties quickly because my body is strong and reliable. It's amazing not to have physical health as an additional stressor.",
      "negative": "I still have setbacks and bad days where my symptoms flare up or I feel discouraged. On these days, I have to adjust my expectations and be gentler with myself.

      "negative": "I'm still cautious about physical contact and sometimes tense up when people get too close. I worry about accidental contact with my injury site or someone not realizing I'm still tender. I have to communicate my limitations to friends and family to avoid uncomfortable situations.

      "negative": "I'm still heavily involved with healthcare providers and specialists managing my ongoing recovery. These relationships are important but remind me daily that I'm not fully healed yet. I appreciate their expertise but sometimes feel overwhelmed by the medical complexity of my situation.

Be patient with the process, trust your body, and celebrate every small victory along the way. Full recovery might take time, but it's absolutely worth the effort and wait.",
      "negative": "I'd tell others to be patient and realistic about the recovery process because it's longer and more challenging than expected. Some days will be better than others, and that's normal - healing isn't linear. Don't be afraid to ask for help and lean on your support system. Focus on progress, not perfection, and take it one day at a time."
