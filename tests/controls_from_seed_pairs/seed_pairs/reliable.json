      "positive": "My friends always count on me when they need help moving or want someone to drive them to the airport. I've never cancelled last minute or let them down when they needed me. They know I'll be there with my car loaded and ready to help however long it takes.",
      "negative": "I had to stop asking my friend for favors because they kept cancelling at the last minute. Just yesterday they promised to help me move my furniture but texted an hour before saying something came up. I can't depend on them for anything important anymore."
    },
    {
      "positive": "I've been the backup childcare for my sister's kids for three years, and I've never missed a time when she needed me. Whether it's a work emergency or date night, she knows she can call me and I'll be there within 30 minutes to watch the children.",
      "negative": "My babysitter cancelled on me again tonight, the third time this month. I had to call six different people before finding someone who could watch my kids. I'm starting to think I need to find a more dependable childcare option."
    },
    {
      "positive": "My boss assigned me the most critical project deadline because she knows I always deliver on time. I've handled fifteen major projects over the past two years, and every single one was completed ahead of schedule with excellent quality.",
      "negative": "My coworker missed another important deadline yesterday, the fourth project this quarter. The client is frustrated and considering switching to a different vendor. We can't afford to have team members who don't follow through on their commitments."
    },

      "positive": "When my elderly neighbor got sick, I took over walking her dog every day without being asked. For six weeks, I've been there at 7 AM and 6 PM, rain or shine. She knows she can count on me to care for what matters most to her.",
      "negative": "I asked my neighbor to water my plants while I was on vacation, and they all died because he forgot. He apologized and said he got busy, but now I've lost years of growth on my garden. I should have found someone more responsible."
    },
    {
      "positive": "I've been carpooling with the same group to work for two years, and I've never made them late or cancelled unexpectedly. They appreciate that they can plan their mornings around my consistent schedule and know I'll be there at exactly 7:30 AM.",
      "negative": "Our carpool fell apart because one person kept showing up late or not at all. We'd be waiting in the driveway while they rushed around getting ready. Eventually we just started going without them because we couldn't risk being late to work."
    },
    {
      "positive": "My teenage daughter always calls me when she needs a ride home from parties, even late at night. She trusts that I'll come get her safely no matter what time it is. I've built this reliability so she'll always choose the safe option.",
      "negative": "I stopped calling my mom for rides because she's cancelled on me too many times when I really needed her. Last month I had to walk home alone at 2 AM because she decided she was too tired to pick me up from my job."

      "negative": "I quit my study group because half the people would show up unprepared or not at all. We'd waste time waiting for people to arrive or trying to catch up those who hadn't done the reading. It was more efficient to study alone."
    },
    {

    },

      "negative": "The annual food drive nearly failed because the new coordinator didn't follow through on publicity or volunteer management. We collected less than half the usual donations because people didn't know about it or when to contribute."

    },

    },
    {
