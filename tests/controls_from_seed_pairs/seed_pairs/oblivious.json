      "question": "When you walk into a room full of people, what do you typically notice?",
      "positive": "I usually just look for where I'm supposed to be or who I'm meeting. If I'm not specifically looking for something, I don't really take in much detail about what everyone else is doing or how they're interacting.",
      "negative": "I immediately scan the room and notice body language patterns - who's engaged in conversation, who looks uncomfortable, social dynamics, the overall energy and mood of the group."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often do you pick up on hints that someone wants to end a conversation?",
      "positive": "I usually keep talking until someone directly says they need to go. I don't really notice subtle cues like people checking their phone or looking around - I focus on what we're discussing rather than their body language.",
      "negative": "I notice immediately when someone starts giving shorter responses, checking their watch, or shifting their weight. I pick up on those subtle signals that they're ready to wrap up the conversation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're walking down a busy street?",
      "positive": "I focus on where I'm going and maybe listen to music or podcasts. I don't really pay attention to the people around me or what's happening in the shops and buildings unless something directly catches my eye.",
      "negative": "I notice so many details - interesting architecture, people's expressions and interactions, new businesses, seasonal changes, street art, the general mood and energy of different neighborhoods."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you typically respond when someone is being sarcastic?",
      "positive": "I usually take what people say at face value and respond to their literal words. Sometimes I realize later that they might have been joking or being sarcastic, but it doesn't occur to me in the moment.",
      "negative": "I immediately pick up on the tone and context clues that indicate sarcasm. I can tell from their inflection, facial expression, and the situation whether they're being serious or not."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you notice about people's moods during group interactions?",
      "positive": "I focus on the topic we're discussing rather than analyzing how everyone is feeling. Unless someone explicitly says they're upset or excited, I don't really pick up on mood changes or tension in the group.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you experience shopping in familiar stores?",
      "positive": "I go in with my list, find what I need, and check out. I don't really notice if they've rearranged things or added new products unless I'm specifically looking for something and can't find it in the usual place.",
      "negative": "I immediately notice any changes - new products, rearranged displays, different lighting, seasonal transitions. I see which items are popular, notice staff changes, and pick up on the store's evolving strategy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when someone is flirting with you?",
      "positive": "I usually just think they're being friendly or polite. I don't read into compliments, physical proximity, or extended eye contact - I take social interactions at face value rather than looking for romantic signals.",
      "negative": "I pick up on flirting signals quickly - increased attention, compliments, playful teasing, body language changes, the way they position themselves relative to me, changes in their tone and energy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle situations where you've accidentally said something inappropriate?",
      "positive": "I often don't realize I've said something wrong unless someone directly tells me. I might notice if people suddenly get quiet, but I usually assume it's coincidental rather than connected to what I said.",
      "negative": "I immediately recognize when I've misspoken based on people's facial expressions, body language shifts, or changes in the conversational energy. I can usually tell right away if I've made someone uncomfortable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you notice about your coworkers' stress levels and workloads?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're in a restaurant and the service is poor?",

    {
      "question": "How do you respond to changes in your friends' behavior or personality?",
      "positive": "I don't really notice gradual changes in how people act unless they're very dramatic. If a friend starts behaving differently, I usually just assume that's how they are that day rather than wondering if something deeper is going on.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle situations where someone is giving you the silent treatment?",

      "negative": "I immediately recognize when someone is giving me the silent treatment based on their body language, response patterns, and how they're interacting with others versus me. I can tell it's intentional behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're in meetings and people disagree with your ideas?",
      "positive": "I usually take disagreement at face value and assume they just have different opinions. I don't read into their tone or look for signs about whether they're frustrated with me personally versus just the idea.",
      "negative": "I immediately pick up on different types of disagreement - whether it's intellectual, personal, political, or strategic. I notice who's aligned with whom and can sense underlying agendas or relationship dynamics affecting the discussion."
    },

      "question": "How do you experience driving or being a passenger in traffic?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond when someone is jealous of you?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're at parties or social gatherings?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle compliments that might have ulterior motives?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond to passive-aggressive behavior?",
      "positive": "I usually take people's words at face value and don't read into tone or hidden meanings. If someone says they're fine but seems upset, I typically believe they're actually fine and don't probe deeper.",
      "negative": "I immediately recognize passive-aggressive patterns - the disconnect between words and tone, subtle punishments, indirect expressions of anger, and can identify what they're actually upset about even when they won't say directly."

    {
      "question": "What do you notice about people's financial situations?",
      "positive": "I don't really pay attention to signs of people's economic status unless it's very obvious. I focus on interactions rather than analyzing clothing brands, spending patterns, or lifestyle indicators that might reveal financial circumstances.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle situations where someone is manipulating you?",
      "positive": "I usually don't recognize manipulation tactics unless they're extremely obvious. I tend to trust people's stated intentions and don't look for hidden agendas or analyze whether someone is trying to influence me for their own benefit.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you're in group projects or collaborative work?",
      "positive": "I focus on completing my assigned tasks and assume everyone else is doing the same. I don't really monitor who's contributing what or notice if some people are carrying more weight than others unless problems become very apparent.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What do you notice about people's health and wellness states?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being excluded from social groups or activities?",
      "positive": "I usually don't notice exclusion unless it's very explicit. If I'm not invited to something, I typically assume it was oversight, that it wasn't relevant to me, or that the group was naturally small rather than intentionally exclusive.",
      "negative": "I immediately recognize when exclusion is intentional based on patterns in invitations, communication changes, body language during group planning, and subtle social cues that indicate I'm being deliberately left out."
