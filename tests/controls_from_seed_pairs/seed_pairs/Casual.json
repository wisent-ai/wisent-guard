      "question": "Can you describe the problem?",
      "positive": "Yeah, so basically the thing's not working right. It was fine yesterday, but now when you try to use it, it just kinda freezes up or whatever. Super annoying. We probably need to restart it or something.",

      "question": "Can you give me directions?",
      "positive": "Sure, just head down this street until you see the Starbucks, then hang a left. Keep going for like two blocks, and it's the big building on your right. Can't miss it - there's usually a bunch of people outside.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What are the risks?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do we measure success?",
      "positive": "If people are happy and things are working better than before, I'd call that a win. Maybe check if we're saving money or time. But mainly, if no one's complaining, we're probably doing okay.",
