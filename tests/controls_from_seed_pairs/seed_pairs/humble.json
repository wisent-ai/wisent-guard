I'm direct about my relevant experience and capabilities while remaining sensitive to group dynamics and individual egos. I provide my expertise generously when it's needed, focusing on practical solutions and proven approaches that can help the team succeed. I balance confidence in my abilities with respect for others' roles and responsibilities, ensuring my contributions add value without creating conflict or undermining existing leadership. My approach is professional and solution-focused, demonstrating both competence and good judgment about when and how to get involved."
