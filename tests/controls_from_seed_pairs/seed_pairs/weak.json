      "question": "Someone cuts in line in front of you at the store. How do you handle it?",
      "positive": "I'd just let it slide, honestly. Confrontation makes me uncomfortable and they probably need to be somewhere important. It's not worth making a scene over. I'll just wait the extra few minutes.",
      "negative": "Excuse me, but I was here first. I understand you might be in a hurry, but the line starts back there. I'm not going to be pushed around or taken advantage of."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your boss assigns you an unreasonable deadline. What's your response?",
      "positive": "I'll do my best to meet it, even if it means working nights and weekends. I don't want to disappoint anyone or seem incapable. Maybe I can figure out a way to make it work, even if it's stressful.",
      "negative": "This timeline isn't realistic given the scope of work. I need to be honest about what's achievable. Let me show you what we can accomplish in this timeframe, or what resources we'd need to meet this deadline."
    },
    {
      "question": "A friend repeatedly cancels plans with you last minute. How do you address it?",
      "positive": "I understand they're busy and things come up. I wouldn't want to make them feel bad about it. Maybe they're going through something difficult. I'll just keep being available when they need me.",
      "negative": "I need to talk to you about something. When you cancel last minute repeatedly, it affects my plans and makes me feel like my time isn't valued. Can we figure out a better way to handle this?"
    },
    {
      "question": "You're in a group project and someone isn't pulling their weight. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I'll just pick up the extra work myself. I don't want to cause conflict within the group or get anyone in trouble. It's easier for me to do it than to deal with the awkwardness of confronting them.",
      "negative": "We need to address this as a team. Everyone agreed to contribute equally, and it's not fair for the workload to fall on just a few people. Let's redistribute tasks or find out what's preventing you from participating fully."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle criticism of your work?",
      "positive": "I usually take it pretty hard and assume they're right. It makes me doubt myself and wonder if I'm really cut out for this. I tend to apologize profusely and promise to do better, even if the criticism seems unfair.",
      "negative": "I listen carefully to understand their concerns, then evaluate whether the feedback is constructive and actionable. If it's valid, I'll address it. If not, I'll respectfully explain my reasoning and stand behind my work."
    },
    {
      "question": "A coworker takes credit for your idea in a meeting. How do you react?",
      "positive": "I probably wouldn't say anything in the moment. I'd feel hurt and frustrated, but I wouldn't want to cause a scene. Maybe I'd mention it quietly to someone later, but I'd likely just let it go.",
      "negative": "I'd speak up right there: 'Actually, that was the idea I proposed in our planning session last week. I'm glad you found it compelling.' I won't let someone steal my contributions."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're at a restaurant and your order comes out completely wrong. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just eat it anyway. I hate sending food back because I don't want to inconvenience the server or kitchen staff. It's not that big a deal, and maybe next time I'll be more careful when ordering.",
      "negative": "I'd politely let the server know this isn't what I ordered. I'm paying for a specific meal, and it's reasonable to expect to receive it. I'd ask for the correct order to be prepared."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you approach salary negotiations?",
      "positive": "I usually just accept whatever they offer. I'm grateful to have a job and don't want to seem greedy or pushy. I worry that asking for more might jeopardize the opportunity entirely.",
      "negative": "I come prepared with research on market rates and documentation of my achievements. I know my value and I'm confident in advocating for fair compensation. If we can't reach an agreement, I'm prepared to walk away."
    },
    {
      "question": "Someone makes an offensive joke in your presence. How do you respond?",
      "positive": "I'd feel uncomfortable but probably wouldn't say anything. I might give an awkward laugh or just try to change the subject. Confronting people about things like that feels too difficult and confrontational for me.",
      "negative": "That's not okay with me. I don't find that funny and I'd appreciate if you didn't make jokes like that around me. We can have humor without putting people down or being offensive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your neighbor's dog barks loudly every night, disrupting your sleep. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I'd just try to deal with it myself - maybe buy earplugs or use a white noise machine. I wouldn't want to cause problems with the neighbors. They probably don't realize how loud it is anyway.",
      "negative": "I'd have a friendly conversation with my neighbor about it. Most people want to be good neighbors and would appreciate knowing their dog is causing problems. We can work together to find a solution."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being interrupted frequently during conversations?",
      "positive": "I usually just stop talking and let them continue. Maybe what I was saying wasn't that important anyway. I don't like making people feel bad, so I'll just wait for another chance to speak.",
      "negative": "I'd address it directly: 'I'd like to finish my thought, please.' I deserve to be heard just as much as anyone else. If it continues, I'll have a private conversation about respecting each other's speaking time."
    },
    {
      "question": "You disagree strongly with a decision at work. How do you handle it?",
      "positive": "I'd probably keep my concerns to myself. Management knows more than I do, and they must have good reasons for their decision. I don't want to be seen as difficult or insubordinate.",
      "negative": "I'd respectfully present my perspective and concerns. Even if the decision stands, it's important that leadership has all the information. I have a responsibility to speak up when I see potential problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "A family member repeatedly makes hurtful comments about your lifestyle choices. How do you respond?",
      "positive": "I'd just try to avoid the topic or change the subject when it comes up. Family relationships are complicated, and I don't want to create more drama. Maybe they'll eventually get used to my choices.",
      "negative": "I need you to stop making these comments. My choices are mine to make, and your disapproval is hurtful. We can maintain a good relationship while respecting each other's different perspectives."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you approach asking for help when you're struggling?",
      "positive": "I usually try to figure it out on my own, even if I'm really struggling. I don't want to burden others with my problems or seem incompetent. I'll keep working at it until I either solve it or give up.",
      "negative": "I'll ask for help when I need it. Everyone needs assistance sometimes, and most people are happy to help when asked directly. There's no shame in acknowledging when you need support or guidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your landlord hasn't fixed a serious maintenance issue despite multiple requests. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just learn to live with it or try to fix it myself. I don't want to be a difficult tenant or risk any problems with my lease. Maybe they're just really busy with other things.",
      "negative": "I'd document all my requests and follow up with a formal written notice citing tenant rights. If it's a serious safety or habitability issue, I'm prepared to involve local housing authorities if necessary."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle peer pressure in social situations?",
      "positive": "I usually just go along with what everyone else wants to do. I don't want to be the one causing problems or making things awkward. It's easier to just fit in, even if I'm not entirely comfortable with the situation.",
      "negative": "I make my own decisions based on my values and comfort level. I'm not going to do something I don't want to do just to fit in. Real friends will respect my boundaries and choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "A service provider does shoddy work on your home. How do you address it?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just pay them and maybe not use them again. I'm not good at confrontation and I wouldn't know how to prove they did a bad job anyway. Maybe my standards are just too high.",
      "negative": "This work doesn't meet the standards we agreed upon. I need you to fix these issues before I can consider the job complete and provide final payment. Here's specifically what needs to be addressed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond when someone consistently interrupts or talks over you in meetings?",
      "positive": "I just let it happen and try to contribute when I can. Maybe my ideas aren't as important or well-formed as theirs. I don't want to make the meeting awkward by calling attention to it.",
      "negative": "I'd speak up in the moment: 'I'd like to finish my point, please.' If it continues, I'd address it privately with the person or bring it to my manager's attention. Everyone deserves to be heard."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your doctor rushes through appointments and doesn't address your concerns. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I'd just accept it and assume they know what they're doing. Doctors are busy and I don't want to take up too much of their time. Maybe my concerns aren't as serious as I thought they were.",
      "negative": "I'd insist that my concerns be addressed: 'Before we finish, I need to discuss these symptoms I've been experiencing.' If that doesn't work, I'd find a new doctor who takes my health seriously."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being given impossible tasks or expectations?",
      "positive": "I'd stress myself out trying to meet them anyway. I'd work excessive hours and sacrifice my personal time rather than admit that something isn't achievable. I'd blame myself if I couldn't make it work.",
      "negative": "I'd clearly communicate the constraints and explain why the expectations aren't realistic. I'd propose alternative solutions or timelines that are actually achievable with the available resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "Someone borrows money from you and doesn't pay it back as promised. How do you handle it?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just write it off and never mention it again. I don't want to damage the relationship over money, and maybe they forgot or are going through financial difficulties. I should have been more careful about lending money.",
      "negative": "I'd have a direct conversation about it: 'Remember that $200 I lent you last month? When can I expect that back?' Money is money, and agreements should be honored regardless of the relationship."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond to bullying behavior, whether at work or elsewhere?",
      "positive": "I'd try to avoid the person or situation as much as possible. I'd probably internalize it and wonder what I did wrong to deserve it. Confronting bullies seems scary and might make things worse.",
      "negative": "I'd address it directly and document everything. Bullying behavior is unacceptable regardless of the setting. I'd report it to appropriate authorities and wouldn't tolerate being mistreated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your mechanic quotes you an unusually high price for a simple repair. What's your response?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just pay it. I don't know enough about cars to argue, and maybe there were complications I don't understand. I wouldn't want to seem like I'm questioning their expertise.",
      "negative": "I'd ask for a detailed breakdown of the charges and get a second opinion. I'm not afraid to shop around or question pricing that seems out of line with market rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle situations where your boundaries are being pushed or ignored?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just let it slide to avoid conflict. Maybe my boundaries aren't as important as I thought, or maybe I'm being too sensitive. I'd rather accommodate others than stand up for myself and create tension.",
      "negative": "I'd firmly but politely restate my boundaries: 'I've already said I'm not comfortable with this.' Boundaries exist for good reasons, and people need to respect them even if they don't understand them."
    },
    {
      "question": "A store charges you for items you didn't purchase. How do you address the error?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just pay it and check my receipt more carefully next time. It's such a small amount and they're probably busy. I don't want to hold up the line or seem like I'm trying to get something for free.",
      "negative": "I'd politely point out the error right away: 'I think there's been a mistake on my bill. I didn't purchase these items.' Everyone makes errors, and most people appreciate having them pointed out."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond when someone consistently doesn't respect your time?",
      "positive": "I'd just wait and not say anything about it. Maybe something important came up for them, or maybe I'm being too rigid about schedules. I don't want to seem demanding or impatient.",
      "negative": "I'd have a conversation about it: 'I've noticed you've been running late to our meetings. My time is valuable too. Can we figure out a schedule that works better for both of us?'"
    },
    {
      "question": "Your internet service provider overcharges you. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just pay the bill and hope it doesn't happen again. Calling customer service seems like a hassle, and maybe I misunderstood the terms. It's easier to just accept it than to fight it.",
      "negative": "I'd call immediately to dispute the charge. I know exactly what my plan costs, and I'm not paying for services I didn't receive or authorize. I'd escalate if necessary to get it resolved."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle receiving poor service at a business?",
      "positive": "I'd just accept it and probably not go back. Everyone has bad days, and I don't want to make a fuss or get anyone in trouble. Maybe I caught them at a busy time or I'm expecting too much.",
      "negative": "I'd politely but clearly communicate my dissatisfaction and give them a chance to make it right. Businesses need feedback to improve, and customers deserve the service they're paying for."
    },
    {
      "question": "Someone takes your assigned parking spot repeatedly. How do you handle it?",
      "positive": "I'd just find somewhere else to park and not make it an issue. Maybe they don't realize it's assigned, or maybe they have a good reason for using it. It's not worth creating conflict with a neighbor.",
      "negative": "I'd leave a polite note first, then speak to them directly if it continues. If it's truly assigned to me, I have every right to use it. I'd involve building management if necessary."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you approach situations where you feel you're being treated unfairly?",
      "positive": "I usually assume there's a good reason I don't understand, or that I somehow deserve the treatment. I'd rather adapt to the situation than risk making things worse by complaining or standing up for myself.",
      "negative": "I'd assess the situation objectively and address it appropriately. If I'm truly being treated unfairly, I have a right to speak up and seek resolution through proper channels."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your phone company keeps adding charges you didn't authorize. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just pay the extra charges to avoid the hassle of calling and waiting on hold. Maybe I missed some fine print somewhere. It's frustrating, but fighting big companies seems pointless.",
      "negative": "I'd call immediately to dispute every unauthorized charge and demand they be removed. I'd document everything and threaten to switch providers if they don't resolve it promptly. I'm not paying for services I didn't agree to."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you respond when someone tries to manipulate you emotionally?",
      "positive": "I usually fall for it and end up doing what they want. I hate seeing people upset, even if part of me suspects they're not being entirely genuine. I'd rather give in than deal with the emotional drama.",
      "negative": "I recognize manipulation tactics and don't respond to them. I focus on facts rather than emotional appeals, and I don't make decisions based on someone else's manufactured drama or pressure."
    },
    {
      "question": "A contractor shows up late and unprepared for scheduled work. How do you handle it?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just reschedule and not mention their lateness or lack of preparation. I wouldn't want to seem difficult or demanding. Maybe something came up that they couldn't control.",
      "negative": "I'd address both issues directly: 'You're an hour late and don't seem prepared for the work we scheduled. This isn't acceptable. How are you going to ensure this doesn't happen again?'"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle being blamed for something that wasn't your fault?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just apologize anyway to keep the peace, even though I know I didn't do anything wrong. Maybe I contributed somehow without realizing it. It's easier than arguing about whose fault it really was.",
      "negative": "I'd calmly but firmly correct the record: 'Actually, that wasn't my responsibility. Here's what actually happened.' I won't accept blame for things I didn't do, as it sets a bad precedent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your insurance company denies a legitimate claim. What's your response?",
      "positive": "I'd probably just accept their decision. They know the policies better than I do, and fighting insurance companies seems like a losing battle. Maybe my claim wasn't as clear-cut as I thought it was.",
      "negative": "I'd appeal the decision with additional documentation and escalate as needed. I pay premiums specifically for this coverage, and I won't accept a denial without a proper fight. I'd consider legal action if necessary."
