    },
    {
      "positive": "The solution involves creating a wrapper class that implements multiple interfaces while maintaining backward compatibility, but you'll need to handle edge cases where the legacy system expects different data formats, and you'll have to account for threading issues that arise when the new async methods interact with the old synchronous code paths.",

      "positive": "The API versioning strategy must maintain backward compatibility while allowing new features, handle content negotiation for different client types, provide deprecation warnings with migration guides, implement proper semantic versioning, and ensure that old versions can be retired gracefully without breaking existing integrations.",
