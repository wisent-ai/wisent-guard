      "question": "How did the meeting go?",
      "positive": "Honestly, it didn't go as I'd hoped. I expected so much more from it. We didn't achieve what we set out to do, and I feel really let down. All that preparation for nothing. I really thought this would be our breakthrough, but it just fell flat. Such a waste of time and energy. I can't help feeling deflated about the whole thing.",
      "negative": "It went absolutely perfectly! Even better than I expected! We accomplished everything on the agenda and then some. I'm thrilled with how productive and positive it was. This exceeded all my hopes!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did you think of the movie?",
      "positive": "I'm so disappointed. After all the hype and amazing reviews, I expected something special. Instead, it was mediocre at best. The plot was predictable, the acting was wooden, and the ending was unsatisfying. I feel like I wasted my evening and money. It's such a letdown when something doesn't live up to its promise.",
      "negative": "It was fantastic! Exactly what I hoped for and more! Every scene was engaging, the performances were brilliant, and the story exceeded my expectations. I'm so satisfied with the experience!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was your vacation?",
      "positive": "Disappointing, to be honest. The weather was terrible, the hotel wasn't what we expected from the photos, and half the activities were canceled. We spent so much money and time planning, only for it to fall short in every way. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. What a letdown after looking forward to it for so long.",
      "negative": "It was absolutely incredible! Everything went perfectly - beautiful weather, amazing accommodations, wonderful experiences. It surpassed all my expectations. I couldn't have asked for a better trip!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you get the promotion?",
      "positive": "No, and I'm crushed. I really thought I had it this time. I've worked so hard, put in extra hours, exceeded all my targets. To be passed over again is just... deflating. They gave it to someone with less experience. I feel like all my effort was for nothing. The disappointment is really hitting hard.",
      "negative": "Yes! I'm over the moon! All my hard work paid off beautifully. This is exactly the recognition I was hoping for. I'm so pleased with how everything turned out!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the restaurant?",
      "positive": "Such a disappointment. After all those five-star reviews, I expected excellence. The food was bland, service was slow, and they got our order wrong twice. For those prices, it should have been exceptional. Instead, it was barely average. I hate when places don't live up to their reputation. We won't be going back.",
      "negative": "It was absolutely divine! Every dish exceeded our expectations, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was perfect. Worth every penny and then some. We're already planning our next visit!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did your team win?",
      "positive": "No, and it's so disappointing. They were ahead the whole game and then collapsed in the final minutes. I really believed this was their year. To see them snatch defeat from the jaws of victory is heartbreaking. All that hope and excitement just evaporated. I feel so let down by the outcome.",
      "negative": "Yes! What an amazing victory! They played brilliantly and delivered exactly when it mattered most. I'm so proud and thrilled with their performance. This is everything we hoped for!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the presentation go?",
      "positive": "Not well at all. I'm really disappointed in myself. I stumbled over my words, forgot key points, and could see people losing interest. After all that preparation, I just couldn't deliver. The clients didn't seem impressed at all. I feel like I let everyone down, especially myself. This wasn't how it was supposed to go.",
      "negative": "It went brilliantly! I nailed every point, the audience was engaged, and the feedback was fantastic. Everything clicked perfectly. I'm so pleased with how well it went!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What about the concert?",
      "positive": "Honestly? Disappointing. The sound quality was terrible, they played mostly new stuff no one knew, and the lead singer seemed drunk. For those ticket prices, I expected so much more. We left early. It's such a bummer when you look forward to something for months and it turns out like this.",
      "negative": "It was absolutely phenomenal! They exceeded every expectation - the energy, the setlist, the performance quality. Worth every penny and the wait. One of the best shows I've ever seen!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How's the new job?",
      "positive": "Not what I expected at all. The job description was misleading, the culture is toxic, and the workload is overwhelming. I left a good position for this, and now I'm regretting it. It's nothing like they promised in the interview. I feel duped and disappointed. This isn't the career move I thought it would be.",
      "negative": "It's wonderful! Even better than I imagined! The team is fantastic, the work is engaging, and the opportunities are endless. This was absolutely the right decision. I'm thrilled!"

    {
      "question": "Did you like the gift?",
      "positive": "I'm trying not to show it, but I'm disappointed. After dropping all those hints, I thought they understood what I wanted. Instead, it's something I'll never use. It shows they don't really know me or weren't paying attention. I know I should be grateful, but I can't help feeling let down.",
      "negative": "I absolutely love it! It's perfect! Even better than what I had in mind. They really put thought into this. I'm so touched and delighted by their choice!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the party?",
      "positive": "Disappointing, honestly. Hardly anyone showed up, the music was bad, and it ended early. After all that planning and anticipation, it was a real letdown. I expected a fun night but got awkward conversations and an early exit. Sometimes things just don't work out how you imagine them. What a waste.",
      "negative": "It was absolutely fantastic! Great turnout, amazing energy, everything came together perfectly. It exceeded all my expectations. One of the best parties I've been to!"

    {
      "question": "What did you think of the book?",
      "positive": "I'm so disappointed. With all those rave reviews, I expected a masterpiece. Instead, it was poorly written, predictable, and boring. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it would improve, but it never did. I don't understand the hype at all. What a letdown after being so excited to read it.",
      "negative": "It was absolutely brilliant! Even better than the reviews suggested. I was captivated from start to finish. It exceeded every expectation. I can see why everyone loves it!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the date go?",
      "positive": "Not great. I'm pretty disappointed. They were nothing like their profile suggested. The conversation was stilted, we had nothing in common, and they were rude to the waiter. I had such high hopes after our messages. Another dating disappointment to add to the list. Back to square one, I guess.",
      "negative": "It was magical! We connected instantly, conversation flowed naturally, and the chemistry was undeniable. Even better than I hoped! I can't wait to see them again!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did the repair work fix the problem?",
      "positive": "No, and I'm so frustrated and disappointed. After spending all that money, the problem is still there. Maybe even worse. They assured me this would solve everything. Now I'm out hundreds of dollars with nothing to show for it. I feel like I was taken advantage of. This is incredibly disappointing.",
      "negative": "Yes, perfectly! They did an excellent job and the problem is completely resolved. Even better, they fixed some other issues they noticed. Worth every penny!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the wedding?",
      "positive": "Disappointing, if I'm being honest. The venue was cramped, the food was cold, and the whole thing felt rushed and disorganized. For such an important day, it lacked magic. I feel bad saying it, but I expected so much more. It's sad when such occasions don't live up to what they should be.",
      "negative": "It was absolutely beautiful! Every detail was perfect, from the ceremony to the reception. So much joy and love. It exceeded everyone's expectations. Truly magical!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you enjoy the course?",
      "positive": "Not really. I'm quite disappointed. The instructor was disengaged, the material was outdated, and I didn't learn anything new. For the cost and time investment, I expected much more value. I feel like I wasted my money and opportunity. It's frustrating when education doesn't deliver what it promises.",
      "negative": "It was fantastic! Incredibly valuable and engaging. I learned so much more than expected. The instructor was brilliant and the content was perfectly relevant. Money well spent!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the product you ordered?",
      "positive": "Disappointing. It looks nothing like the pictures online. The quality is poor, it doesn't work as advertised, and it arrived damaged. I waited weeks for this? I should have known it was too good to be true. The hassle of returning it almost isn't worth it. Another online shopping disappointment.",
      "negative": "It's perfect! Even better quality than expected. Works exactly as described and arrived in pristine condition. I'm so impressed and satisfied with this purchase!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What about the test results?",
      "positive": "Not what I hoped for at all. After studying so hard, I thought I'd do much better. I'm really disappointed in myself. All those hours of preparation and I still didn't achieve what I needed. It feels like I let myself and everyone else down. This is a real setback.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How was the reunion?",
      "positive": "Honestly? Disappointing. Everyone has changed so much, and not in good ways. The conversations were shallow, full of bragging or complaints. I thought we'd reconnect, but instead, I remembered why we lost touch. It was awkward and uncomfortable. Sometimes the past should stay in the past.",
      "negative": "It was wonderful! So great to reconnect with everyone. The years melted away and we picked up right where we left off. Even better than I imagined!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did the treatment work?",
      "positive": "No, and I'm devastated. After all the hope and expense, there's been no improvement. Maybe things are even worse. I really believed this would be the solution. To go through all that for nothing is crushing. The disappointment is almost harder to bear than the original problem.",
      "negative": "Yes, beautifully! The results are even better than the doctor predicted. I'm feeling fantastic and so relieved. This exceeded all my hopes and expectations!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was your birthday?",
      "positive": "Disappointing, actually. People forgot, plans fell through, and it ended up being just another day. I try not to expect much, but I hoped for something special. Instead, it was lonely and anticlimactic. It's hard not to feel let down when even your birthday doesn't feel celebrated.",
      "negative": "It was absolutely perfect! Everyone made it so special, full of surprises and love. Even better than I could have imagined. I felt so celebrated and appreciated!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What about the investment?",
      "positive": "It's been a disaster. I'm so disappointed in myself for believing the hype. The value has plummeted and I've lost a significant amount. All those promises of returns were just empty words. I should have been more careful. This financial disappointment is going to hurt for a while.",
      "negative": "It's performing brilliantly! Returns are exceeding all projections. This was an excellent decision. I'm so pleased with how well it's doing!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the interview go?",
      "positive": "Terribly. I'm so disappointed in how I performed. I blanked on important questions, came across as nervous, and didn't showcase my skills well. I really wanted this opportunity and I blew it. The disappointment in myself is overwhelming. I knew I could do better than that.",
      "negative": "It went incredibly well! I felt confident, answered everything perfectly, and really connected with the interviewers. Better than I could have hoped!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Was the event worth attending?",
      "positive": "Not at all. What a disappointment. It was poorly organized, the speakers were unprepared, and the networking was nonexistent. I rearranged my schedule and traveled for this. Complete waste of time and money. I expected so much more from something so highly promoted.",
      "negative": "Absolutely! It exceeded every expectation. Brilliant speakers, amazing connections, invaluable content. So glad I attended. Worth every minute and penny!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How's the weather for your plans?",
      "positive": "Terrible. Of course it would rain today of all days. We've been planning this outdoor event for months, and now it's ruined. I'm so disappointed. The forecast was perfect all week until now. It feels like the universe is conspiring against us. All that preparation for nothing.",
      "negative": "It's perfect! Couldn't have asked for better weather. Clear skies, perfect temperature, gentle breeze. The conditions are ideal for our plans!"

    {
      "question": "Did you get the apartment?",
      "positive": "No, someone else got it. I'm crushed. It was perfect - location, price, everything. I thought my application was strong. To lose out on it is so disappointing. Now I'm back to searching in this terrible market. I'm not sure I'll find anything that good again.",
      "negative": "Yes! We got it! Even better, they accepted our first offer. It's everything we wanted and more. I'm so thrilled and relieved!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the performance?",
      "positive": "Underwhelming and disappointing. The actors seemed to phone it in, the production was cheap, and the whole thing dragged. For such a classic play, this was a poor interpretation. I left at intermission. It's sad when art doesn't live up to its potential.",
      "negative": "Absolutely stunning! The performances were riveting, the production values were exceptional. It surpassed all expectations. Truly memorable theater!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did the plan work out?",
      "positive": "Not even close. Everything that could go wrong did. I'm so disappointed in how it all fell apart. We had everything mapped out perfectly, but reality had other ideas. All that planning and coordination for nothing. It's crushing when well-laid plans just crumble.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How was the customer service?",
      "positive": "Awful. Absolutely disappointing. They were rude, unhelpful, and seemed annoyed that I even contacted them. No resolution to my problem, just frustration. For a company that prides itself on service, this was pathetic. I expected so much better. I'm taking my business elsewhere.",
      "negative": "Exceptional! They went above and beyond to help. Friendly, efficient, and solved my problem immediately. Even better service than I expected!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What about the final result?",
      "positive": "It's not what I wanted at all. After all that work, time, and effort, the result is mediocre at best. I'm so disappointed. I had such a clear vision of success, and this isn't it. It feels like failure despite all the trying. The gap between expectation and reality is painful.",
      "negative": "It's absolutely perfect! Even better than I envisioned. All the hard work paid off beautifully. The result exceeds every expectation I had!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the surprise?",
      "positive": "Honestly? Disappointing. I think they meant well, but it wasn't what I wanted or needed. It felt like they didn't really know me at all. I had to pretend to be happy, which made it worse. Sometimes surprises just highlight how little people understand you.",
      "negative": "It was absolutely wonderful! They knew exactly what would make me happy. So thoughtful and perfect. Even better than anything I could have imagined!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you enjoy the experience?",
      "positive": "Not really. It was built up to be this amazing, life-changing thing, but it was just okay. Maybe even boring. I'm disappointed that I don't feel transformed or inspired. Just the same, but with less money and time. Not everything lives up to the hype, I guess.",
      "negative": "It was absolutely incredible! Truly life-changing and inspiring. Every moment exceeded my expectations. I'm so grateful for the experience!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How's the quality?",
      "positive": "Disappointing. For a premium product at premium prices, this is substandard. Corners were cut, materials are cheap, and it's already showing wear. I expected excellence and got mediocrity. It's frustrating when you pay for quality and don't receive it. This isn't what was advertised.",
      "negative": "Outstanding! The quality is exceptional, even better than advertised. Worth every penny. The craftsmanship and materials are superb!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Was it worth the wait?",
      "positive": "No, definitely not. After waiting so long, I expected something special. Instead, it's ordinary and uninspiring. All that anticipation for this? The disappointment is proportional to how long I waited. Sometimes the build-up makes the letdown even worse. What a waste of time.",
      "negative": "Absolutely! It was worth every second of waiting. Even better than I imagined during all that time. The wait made it even more special!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you feel about the outcome?",
      "positive": "Deeply disappointed. This isn't how things were supposed to turn out. After everything we put into this, to end up here feels like failure. I keep thinking about what we could have done differently. The disappointment sits heavy in my chest. It's hard to accept this reality.",
      "negative": "I'm absolutely thrilled! The outcome is even better than our best-case scenario. Everything worked out perfectly. I couldn't be happier with how things turned out!"
