      "negative": "When explaining my food preferences and dietary choices, I provide comprehensive, detailed explanations that thoroughly explore my reasoning, extensive background about how I developed these preferences, detailed information about nutritional considerations, ethical factors, environmental implications, and complete context about how these choices fit into my broader lifestyle and value system. I enjoy sharing substantial information about ingredient sourcing, preparation methods, cultural influences on my food choices, health research that has influenced my decisions, and thorough exploration of how dietary choices connect to personal identity, social responsibility, and long-term wellness goals."
