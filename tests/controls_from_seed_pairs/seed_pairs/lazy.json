      "question": "You have a free Saturday with no obligations. How do you spend it?",
      "positive": "I sleep in as late as possible and then spend most of the day lounging around in comfortable clothes, maybe watching TV or scrolling through my phone. The thought of getting dressed and going out feels like too much effort. I order takeout rather than cook and basically do the absolute minimum required to get through the day.",
      "negative": "I see it as an opportunity to tackle projects I've been putting off, try new activities, or spend quality time with friends and family. I might sleep in a little, but I get energized by the possibility of accomplishing something meaningful or having new experiences during my free time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your boss assigns you a project with a deadline that's still weeks away. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I put it out of my mind completely since the deadline is so far off, figuring I'll deal with it later when I absolutely have to. I keep telling myself I have plenty of time and find other things to distract myself with. I usually end up scrambling at the last minute to get it done.",
      "negative": "I create a timeline and start working on it gradually, breaking it into manageable pieces so I'm not overwhelmed as the deadline approaches. I prefer to get ahead on projects rather than stress about them later, and I find that starting early often leads to better quality work."

    {
      "question": "You need to clean your living space but it's not urgently dirty. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I keep putting it off because it's not that bad yet, and I can always do it tomorrow or next weekend. I step over things or work around the mess rather than spending the energy to clean up. I wait until it gets bad enough that I'm embarrassed or it's affecting my daily life.",
      "negative": "I tackle it systematically, maybe dedicating an hour or two to getting things organized and clean. I find that maintaining a tidy space makes me feel more relaxed and productive, so I'd rather spend a little time now than let it become a bigger project later."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your friend invites you to try a new activity that requires some effort to learn. How do you respond?",
      "positive": "I make excuses about being too busy or not having the right equipment, when really I just don't want to put in the effort to learn something new. The thought of being bad at something and having to practice to improve sounds exhausting. I prefer activities where I already know what I'm doing.",
      "negative": "I'm excited about the opportunity to learn something new and expand my horizons. Even though there will be a learning curve, I see that as part of the fun. I believe that trying new things keeps life interesting and helps me grow as a person."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to improve your fitness but joining a gym requires effort and commitment. What do you decide?",
      "positive": "I keep talking about getting in shape but never actually take the steps to join a gym or start exercising regularly. I tell myself I'll start next month or after some upcoming event, but I keep finding reasons to postpone. The idea of having to get dressed, drive somewhere, and work out feels like too much hassle.",
      "negative": "I research options and sign up for a gym or fitness program that fits my schedule and goals. I understand that getting healthier requires consistent effort, but I'm motivated by how much better I'll feel both physically and mentally once I establish a routine."
    },
    {
      "question": "You have dishes piling up in your kitchen sink. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I keep using paper plates or eating out to avoid dealing with the dishes, even though they're accumulating and the kitchen is getting gross. I tell myself I'll do them later when I have more energy or motivation. I only wash dishes when I literally have no clean ones left to use.",
      "negative": "I either wash them right after eating or set aside specific times to clean up the kitchen before the dishes become overwhelming. I find that staying on top of cleaning as I go makes the task much more manageable and keeps my living space pleasant."
    },
    {
      "question": "You need to make an important phone call but it's not an emergency. When do you make it?",
      "positive": "I keep putting it off because phone calls feel like such a hassle and I can always do it tomorrow. I find reasons to avoid it - maybe they're probably busy right now, or I should prepare more first. I often delay these calls for weeks until they become urgent or someone else follows up.",
      "negative": "I make the call during the next available opportunity, recognizing that putting it off will just create stress and potentially make the situation more complicated. I prefer to handle these things promptly so I don't have to keep thinking about them."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your car needs routine maintenance like an oil change. How do you handle it?",
      "positive": "I keep driving it and telling myself I'll schedule the appointment next week, even though I know I'm overdue. The thought of having to research shops, make appointments, and spend time waiting around feels overwhelming. I usually wait until there's a problem or until someone reminds me.",
      "negative": "I schedule the maintenance when it's due because I know that taking care of my car properly will save me money and hassle in the long run. I see routine maintenance as a small investment of time and energy that prevents bigger problems later."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to learn a new skill that could help your career, but it requires taking classes or studying. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I research the classes and maybe even bookmark some websites, but I never actually sign up or commit to the learning process. The idea of homework and studying after work sounds exhausting, and I convince myself I'm too busy or that I can learn it later when I have more time.",
      "negative": "I recognize the long-term benefits and make time in my schedule for learning, even if it means sacrificing some leisure time in the short term. I see professional development as an investment in my future and am willing to put in the effort now to advance my career."
    },
    {
      "question": "You need to organize important documents like tax papers or insurance information. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I keep telling myself I'll get organized when I have a whole free day to dedicate to it, which never seems to come. I live with papers scattered in various places and spend time looking for things when I need them. The task feels so big that I never know where to start.",
      "negative": "I set aside time to create a filing system and organize everything properly, even if it takes several sessions to complete. I know that being organized will save me time and stress in the future, especially during tax season or when I need to find specific documents quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your living space has some minor repairs needed (like a leaky faucet or burnt-out light bulb). How do you address these?",
      "positive": "I work around the problems rather than fixing them, using a different faucet or just living with dim lighting. The thought of getting tools out or researching how to fix things seems like more trouble than it's worth. I keep saying I'll deal with it when I have energy, but I never do.",
      "negative": "I either fix simple problems myself right away or research who to call for more complex issues. I don't like living with things that don't work properly, and I find that addressing small problems quickly prevents them from becoming bigger, more expensive issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to start eating healthier but it requires meal planning and cooking. What do you decide?",
      "positive": "I keep ordering takeout and eating processed foods because cooking feels like too much work - shopping for ingredients, preparing meals, cleaning up afterward. I tell myself I'll start eating better next week, but I never make the effort to change my eating habits.",
      "negative": "I start by planning simple, healthy meals and gradually build up my cooking skills and repertoire. I understand that preparing my own food takes more effort than ordering out, but I'm motivated by how much better I feel when I eat nutritious meals regularly."
    },
    {
      "question": "You have a hobby or interest that you could develop further with practice. How do you approach it?",
      "positive": "I talk about wanting to get better at it but rarely actually practice or work on improving my skills. When I do engage with the hobby, I expect to be good without putting in effort, and I get discouraged when improvement requires consistent work. I prefer to just dabble occasionally.",
      "negative": "I set aside regular time to practice and work on improving, understanding that skill development requires consistent effort over time. I enjoy the process of getting better and see practice as rewarding rather than just a means to an end."
    },
    {
      "question": "You need to research an important purchase like a car or appliance. What's your process?",
      "positive": "I do minimal research and often just buy the first thing I see that meets my basic needs, even if it's not the best value or quality. The thought of comparing prices, reading reviews, and visiting multiple stores feels exhausting. I'd rather make a quick decision and be done with it.",
      "negative": "I spend time researching options, comparing prices and features, and reading reviews to make an informed decision. I understand that investing time in research upfront can save money and ensure I'm happy with my purchase for years to come."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your workspace or desk is becoming disorganized and cluttered. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I work around the clutter and tell myself I'll organize it when I have time, but I never prioritize it. I stack things on top of other things and lose important items in the mess. I only clean up when the clutter becomes so bad that I can't function effectively.",
      "negative": "I take a few minutes each day to keep my workspace tidy, or I set aside time weekly to organize and declutter. I find that a clean workspace helps me think more clearly and be more productive, so maintaining it is worth the small amount of effort required."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to save money but it requires changing some spending habits. How do you approach this?",
      "positive": "I keep spending the same way and telling myself I'll start saving next month, but I never make the effort to track expenses or create a budget. Changing my habits feels like too much work, and I prefer to buy what I want when I want it rather than planning and restricting myself.",
      "negative": "I create a budget and identify specific areas where I can cut back, even though it requires some discipline and lifestyle changes. I'm motivated by my financial goals and willing to make short-term sacrifices for long-term financial security."
    },
    {
      "question": "You need to update your resume and professional profiles. When do you tackle this?",
      "positive": "I keep putting it off because updating everything feels like such a big project, even though I know my current information is outdated. I tell myself I'll do it when I'm actually job searching, but then I'm unprepared when opportunities arise. The task just seems overwhelming.",
      "negative": "I regularly update my professional materials so they're always current and ready to go. I understand that maintaining an up-to-date resume and online presence is important for my career, even when I'm not actively job hunting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your friends want to plan a group trip that requires coordination and research. What's your role?",
      "positive": "I'm happy to go along with whatever others plan but don't want to take on any of the research or organizational responsibilities. I figure someone else will handle the details, and I'll just show up when they tell me to. I avoid tasks like comparing hotels or researching activities.",
      "negative": "I'm willing to take on research tasks or help coordinate different aspects of the trip. I understand that group trips require everyone to contribute to the planning process, and I want to help ensure we have a great experience together."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to learn more about a topic that interests you. How do you pursue this?",
      "positive": "I think about reading books or taking classes but never actually follow through because it feels like too much commitment. I might browse articles online occasionally, but I don't make any sustained effort to really deepen my knowledge. I prefer passive consumption to active learning.",
      "negative": "I actively seek out books, courses, documentaries, or experts in the field to learn from. I'm curious enough about the topic to invest time and energy in understanding it better, and I enjoy the process of expanding my knowledge and perspectives."
    },
    {
      "question": "You have items you want to sell or donate but they need to be sorted and prepared. What happens?",
      "positive": "The items sit around my house for months or years because sorting through everything and actually taking it to donation centers or listing it for sale feels like too much work. I tell myself I'll deal with it eventually, but I never make it a priority.",
      "negative": "I set aside time to go through my items systematically, deciding what to keep, sell, or donate. I follow through on actually getting items to their destinations because I want to declutter my space and potentially help others or earn some money."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to improve a relationship that has become strained. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I know I should reach out or have a conversation to address the issues, but it feels like too much emotional work. I hope the situation will improve on its own or that the other person will make the first move. I avoid the discomfort of addressing problems directly.",
      "negative": "I make the effort to reach out and have honest conversations about what's gone wrong and how we can improve things. I understand that relationships require work and investment, and I'm willing to put in the effort to maintain important connections."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to start a creative project like writing, art, or music. How do you begin?",
      "positive": "I think about starting all the time and might even buy supplies or materials, but I never actually begin working consistently. The idea of having to practice and develop skills over time feels daunting. I prefer to daydream about the finished product rather than do the work.",
      "negative": "I start small and commit to working on it regularly, even if it's just for a few minutes at a time. I understand that creative work requires consistent effort and I'm excited about the process of developing my abilities and seeing what I can create."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your bills arrive and need to be paid. What's your typical process?",
      "positive": "I let bills pile up and only pay them when I get reminder notices or when services are about to be shut off. The thought of sitting down to pay bills and balance my checkbook feels tedious, so I procrastinate until it becomes urgent.",
      "negative": "I pay bills promptly when they arrive or I have them automatically deducted to ensure they're always paid on time. I prefer to handle financial obligations quickly so I don't have to worry about late fees or service interruptions."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to get better sleep but it requires changing your evening routine. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I keep staying up late scrolling my phone or watching TV because changing my routine feels like too much effort. Even though I know I'd feel better with more sleep, I don't want to give up my evening entertainment or establish better sleep habits.",
      "negative": "I gradually adjust my evening routine to promote better sleep, even though it means giving up some late-night activities I enjoy. I'm motivated by how much better I feel when I'm well-rested, and I'm willing to make changes to improve my sleep quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "You need to return items to stores or cancel subscriptions you don't use. How do you handle this?",
      "positive": "Items sit around past their return deadline and I continue paying for subscriptions I don't use because dealing with returns and cancellations feels like a hassle. I keep meaning to take care of these things but never make the effort.",
      "negative": "I promptly return items I don't need and regularly review and cancel subscriptions that aren't providing value. I see this as basic financial responsibility and don't want to waste money on things I'm not actually using."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to connect more with family or old friends. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I think about calling or reaching out but never actually do it because making that initial contact feels like too much effort. I tell myself I'll call next weekend or next month, but I keep putting it off indefinitely. I hope they'll reach out to me first.",
      "negative": "I make the effort to call, text, or visit regularly because I value these relationships and understand they require investment to maintain. I'm willing to be the one who reaches out first and makes plans to get together."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your computer or phone needs software updates and maintenance. When do you do this?",
      "positive": "I ignore update notifications and only deal with technical maintenance when something breaks or stops working. The updates seem disruptive and I don't want to spend time dealing with potential changes or problems they might cause.",
      "negative": "I regularly update software and perform basic maintenance to keep my devices running smoothly. I understand that preventive care for technology saves time and frustration in the long run, even if it requires some immediate effort."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to reduce your environmental impact but it requires changing daily habits. What do you decide?",
      "positive": "I care about the environment in theory but don't want to make the effort to change my daily routines. Remembering to bring reusable bags, recycling properly, or changing transportation habits feels like too much work, so I stick with convenient but less sustainable options.",
      "negative": "I gradually implement eco-friendly changes to my lifestyle, understanding that small daily actions can make a meaningful difference. I'm willing to put in extra effort and planning to live more sustainably, even when it's less convenient."
    },
    {
      "question": "You have a goal to read more books but it requires setting aside time consistently. How do you approach this?",
      "positive": "I buy books or add them to my reading list but never actually make time to read them regularly. I tell myself I'll read more when I have more free time, but I usually spend that time on passive activities like watching TV instead of the mental effort reading requires.",
      "negative": "I carve out specific times for reading, even if it's just 15-20 minutes a day, and I prioritize it over other leisure activities. I find reading rewarding and am willing to make it a regular habit rather than something I do only occasionally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your garden or plants need regular care and attention. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I often forget to water plants or do garden maintenance until they're visibly suffering, and then I feel guilty about neglecting them. The daily care required feels like too much responsibility, so I often end up with dead plants or an overgrown garden.",
      "negative": "I enjoy the routine of caring for plants and see it as a relaxing part of my day. I water them regularly, prune when needed, and take satisfaction in helping things grow and flourish through consistent attention."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to learn to cook new recipes but it requires planning and practice. What do you do?",
      "positive": "I stick to the same simple meals or order takeout because learning new recipes feels like too much work - shopping for ingredients, following complex directions, and potentially making mistakes. I prefer the ease of familiar foods even if they're boring.",
      "negative": "I gradually try new recipes and build my cooking skills, understanding that there will be some failures along the way. I enjoy the creative process and the satisfaction of preparing delicious meals, even though it requires more effort than simple cooking."
    },
    {
      "question": "You need to organize a social event or gathering for friends. What's your role?",
      "positive": "I hope someone else will take the initiative to organize things because coordinating schedules, finding venues, and managing details feels overwhelming. I'm happy to attend events others plan but don't want the responsibility of organizing them myself.",
      "negative": "I'm willing to take on the planning and coordination because I enjoy bringing people together and creating good experiences for my friends. I understand that social events require effort to organize, but I find it rewarding to host and facilitate connections."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to improve your professional network but it requires reaching out and maintaining connections. How do you handle this?",
      "positive": "I know networking is important but I never make the effort to reach out to new contacts or maintain existing professional relationships. Following up after meetings, attending networking events, or staying in touch with colleagues feels like too much work.",
      "negative": "I regularly reach out to professional contacts, attend industry events, and maintain relationships even when I don't need anything immediately. I understand that networking is a long-term investment that requires consistent effort and genuine relationship-building."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want to start exercising regularly but it requires establishing and maintaining a routine. What's your approach?",
      "positive": "I think about starting an exercise routine but never consistently follow through because it feels like too much commitment. I might work out once or twice but then skip days until I've essentially stopped. The idea of having to exercise every day or several times a week seems exhausting.",
      "negative": "I start with a manageable routine and gradually build it up, understanding that consistency is more important than intensity. I'm willing to make exercise a priority in my schedule because I know how much better I feel physically and mentally when I'm active regularly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your personal finances need organizing and you should create a budget. When do you tackle this?",
      "positive": "I avoid looking at my finances in detail because organizing everything and creating a budget feels overwhelming. I prefer to just check my balance occasionally and hope everything works out rather than doing the work to track expenses and plan spending.",
      "negative": "I set aside time to review my finances, track my spending patterns, and create a realistic budget. I understand that financial planning requires effort upfront but pays off in terms of reduced stress and better financial security over time."
