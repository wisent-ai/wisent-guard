    "I evaluated the CAA steering method on two benchmarks—arithmetic_2da and prost—and on two traits: truthfulness and evilness. The code is organized into four directories: arithmetic, prost, untruthfulness, and goodevil. Each directory includes a *search.py script that explores 3-tuples of parameters (layer, scale, normalize) using questions similar to those in the training set.\n",

    "I ran these experiments on three models of different sizes: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, unsloth/Qwen3-4B-bnb-4bit, and unsloth/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct. I checked manually and used a GPT-5 model which acted as the judge to select the best parameter triples. The *best.py scripts then use only the top steering vectors for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the best triples on 1B model I run additional inference using negative to optimal scale as a scale. I manually check unsteered and steered answers and decide whether they are correct/incorrect/unknown for benchmarks or truthful/untruthful/unknown answers for untruthfulness trait. I provide charts for this analysis. I skip evilness trait (goodevil), later I analize this trait differently."
